      "prefix=item.html_text, event=string, value=Data DigJul 8, 2017How to innovate in life insurance using Analytics and Machine LearningIt is about speed and brevityLife Insurance industry is losing customers year after year with many Gen X, Millenials, and Gen Yers not interested in buying life insurance policies. In the context of declining interest, life insurance companies need to innovate in product development, marketing, servicing, customer experience management, and financial management. Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning techniques provide a way for Life Insurance companies to innovate across these areas. In this article, we cover how life insurance companies can use such techniques to create market differentiating innovations.The challenge for life insurers is that while they are in an ice berg that is melting, up on top, things are looking good. After the 2008, variable annuity driven financial crisis, the life insurance industry has stabilized its books, reduced or eliminated financial risks, and has stabilized its book of business. However, while it has been doing this, the attrition rate on annuities and in life insurance has been increasing with many life insurance firms finding it hard to recoup lost customers. Furthermore, as projected, if the insurance rates go up and inflation also goes up, life insurance industry will continue to have more challenges in retaining its existing customers and grow new pools of customers.In this context, we believe that life insurers can use machine learning and advanced analytics to create new innovations that are differentiated in the market.So, what is machine learningSimply put, machine learning is the ability of a computer to learn a model that could be used to predict various outputs. Things that could be predicted in life insurance can include when a customer will attrite (surrender an annuity contract or stop paying life insurance premium), when a variable annuity holder would increase their withdrawal patterns, life events that drive a consumer’s premium paying behavior (e.g., move), and other factors important to the life insurance business.Machine learning techniques (there is a plethora of them) can be broadly classified into two buckets, based on the number of variables they can use as input. Techniques such as decision trees, non-linear regression models, etc. are typically used where the number of variables used to train (i.e., create) the system are around 25 to 50. The second bucket is made up of techniques that can take several hundreds to thousands of input variables and are usually used in cases where we need to find a “signature”. Examples of these techniques include Deep Learning used for facial recognition, components of speech identification. These buckets of techniques are often used in phenomenological data (i.e., real world signals). This classification is somewhat simplistic as new ground in the machine learning world is using the second bucket of techniques to solve problems that have been solved using the first bucket of techniques.Advanced analytics is a broader and older term where statistical techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression and machine learning techniques are used to create predictive models. Advanced analytics is often used to distinguish predictive analytics application from actuarial and so called descriptive analytics where historical is analyzed to identify patterns based on human intuition.So, how do all these techniques help an insurer create market differentiating capabilities? The following paragraphs drill down into each functional areas of an insurer.Actuarial analysisLife insurance companies and Annuity firms today use assumptions to set aside reserves and to hedge on the market. These assumptions are typically created with actuarial models that create cells of customers based on a few factors (usually less than five) that segment the book of business into equally distributed groups so that actuaries can compute aggregate ratios on attrition, withdrawals, and other factors. Typically, these values are computed for the previous year and compared against historical variations to see if the trend is changing its direction. A more in-depth analysis can step through these changes year to year moving forward or backward by using values from the current year to derive dependencies for the next or previous year.This process creates several problems in the modern market place. Since the number of variables are small emerging trends or trends that are specific to specific customer populations are hard if not impossible to create. So, policies must be priced based on broad characteristics and the burden is shifted to underwriting in the life insurance industry to cover for risks. Annuity contracts must be priced with a significant fee since the risk of withdrawals cannot be estimate precisely and market hedging must be done with large pools of money reducing the flexibility in investment.These factors limit the ability of life insurance companies to react to changing market conditions quickly and to create products that can be better suited for targeted populations of customers.Machine learning techniques are changing the way this process is working in leading life insurers. First, instead of using about five variables to create actuarial assumptions, life insurance companies are adding more variables with a focus on variables that capture the change in behavior of policy and contract holders. Policy holders’ payment, withdrawal, surrender, change in payment mechanisms, and other variables provide fine grain understanding of who, when, and what are driving attritions, withdrawals, and acquisition of related products. Inputs from these machine learning models are also being integrated into the actuarial process to estimate reserves to be established and Monte-Carlo and similar simulation methods for estimating market performance of assets. Furthermore, by incorporating variables that were traditionally considered to be underwriting variables into the actuarial processes, leading edge insurers are reducing the complexity for policy underwriting and supporting the ability to create insurance products that are experience focused and target specific populations (e.g., millennials who are adventure travelers).UnderwritingThe holy grail in life insurance underwriting has been to pre-qualify clients similar to credit card pre-qualification for marketing so that the marketing and writing of life insurance policies is as smooth as friction free as issuing a credit card. Insurers have taken intermediate steps in this direction by installing rule based execution systems for straight through processing and other process optimizations. However, these steps have not made it possible to underwrite a customer without performing medical tests to determine their risk profile. Furthermore, due to the generality of life insurance actuarial models, it has been harder to reduce the number of questions that needed to be answered by the customer.To reduce the need for the medical test, insurance companies are now experimenting with deep learning techniques that use commercially available medical data on radiology images, clinical trial data including blood samples and correlation of blood samples with diseases, text understanding of physician’s notes, etc. taking thousands of variables and predicting occurrence of certain diseases in the customer to be insured and the acute or chronic nature of the disease. While this brave new frontier needs to be carefully managed to avoid regulatory and customer backlash, green lighting policies using deep learning approaches can provide a way to overcome such negative reactions in the market place.The key benefit provided by deep learning is the ability to include the thousands of heterogeneous variables in creating new predictive models that can be used to classify applicants into life insurance pools without performing medical tests. Consider the number of variables that blood samples measure. Add to it variables that radiology images and features that can be extracted from those images that point to specific medical conditions. Combine this with key information about chronic conditions and treatment plan information from doctor notes using text understanding. Enhance this information using life style variables about risky life styles that are usually ascertained by questions asked but now determined using external data sources, the number of variables expand far beyond the ability of conventional advanced analytics models. Deep machine learning techniques allow insurance companies permits life insurance companies to take these multi thousand variable set and predict the applicant’s risk class.Product developmentOne of the key new trends in product development in life insurance and annuity is to create products for Gen Xers, Millennials, and Gen Y. From several projects, we have performed across our life insurance customers, we have seen that products that appeal to the younger generation are temporally relevant. While past generations have bought life insurance products to protect their family or to protect income by paying premiums for a long time (typically, not less than 10 years), younger generations are interested in insuring their life styles over a narrower period. For example, a millennial may be interested in buying life insurance as they rent a zipcar to drive around Boston or may be interested in buying life insurance for a few years after birth of a child.While life insurance policies are available for specific travel (e.g., life insurance for air travel), the idea of life insurance products that protect for a shorter duration, ranging from days to not more than a few years is something that is new to the life insurance industry.How can advanced analytics and deep learning help create these types of products? As mentioned earlier, the actuarial practices work with limited variables but very long history that is meant to predict and price mortality during normal course of life with significant risk in payments spread over many policy holders. However, products that address life styles must deal with shorter time frames and events that are numerous and historical data on their risk is not available for long periods of time.However, with new sources of information that are more real time such as data about life styles collected from fitness devices, health information collected as described above, with deep machine learning’s ability to predict important events that could occur, life insurance companies can create new class of products suited to the life styles of new class of customers opening new avenues of revenue.MarketingLife insurers and annuity companies have significant opportunities in improving their marketing. Most of the companies today sell their product through distribution channels (agents, wirehouses, etc.) and perform brand marketing to establish their firm as a solid company that will not go defunct in the next few years. However, given the nature of these products, customers are very infrequently in touch with the insurance companies except when they would like to surrender their policy or contract or when they wish to claim against the policy. More targeted marketing to retain customers to increase profitability have typically resulted in increased mortality risk carried at the book level by the firms. If effectiveness of marketing is measured in terms of new customers recruited and customers retained, then life insurance company marketing has not been very effective.Advanced analytics and machine learning can be used to address this problem. A general industry pattern is that up to 20% of term life customers attrit in the first 3 years not even paying back the marketing expenses spent on recruiting them. Another 10% to 20% attrite one or two years before term end and premium jumps and up to 50% attrite during so called shock period one year before and one year after the term end (e.g, 10th year for a term-1o policy). It should be clear that retaining customer during the early period and selectively retaining customers who don’t have significant mortality around the shock value period can improve the profitability of an insurer. By creating predictions on which policy holder will attrit when, prospectively identifying the signals and drivers for that attrition, and by better estimating total life time value for those customers, advanced analytics and machine learning techniques can help an insurer better target their existing customers.In addition, this type of targeted marketing combined with machine learning refined underwriting and actuarial practices can create “offers” that are appropriate for the customer. Better estimation of mortality through machine learning driven underwriting and shorter duration life insurance offers (extensions on current policies) can allow insurance companies to target and retain late stage customers whose policy maturity may be imminent. Similarly, for annuities, a better prediction of withdrawal probabilities can allow annuity companies to target contract extensions that will help the customer keep more of their investments with the firm.SummaryAdvanced analytics and machine learning techniques can have fundamental impacts on all aspects of a life insurance and annuity firm. Above, implications of these approaches for most functions of an insurance company was provided.

It delayed the already painful secret and internal struggle of fighting off a piece of my truth as a queer person.At this time in my life only a few people knew of my gay struggle. I labeled it this because I had yet to find a safe haven of queer community to love and support me. I was leaning on the only systematic view of this I knew — it is wrong. The end.Because of this, I was subjecting myself to my own form of conversion therapy through a Baptist pastor’s wife. I attended “bible study” to pray the gay away with another friend this entire year.Why? Because I was programmed to believe through the use of the text five things:You are a woman — The rib is not your own, kidYou were created for the American Dream (God’s Dream) of marrying a nice man and placing a beautiful white picket fence around your homeYour job is to have children and stay silentYour parents are the law of GodDo not question any of thisAny other universe outside of this mythical norm was absolutely an abomination.It is not hard to write the rest of the struggle for myself and so many youths raised inside of this very one-sided Western Culture ideology of man dominates woman.Utterly lost, I lived for parties, the dark, and alcohol. And this is how my #metoo moment unfolds, in the dark, at a party trying to hold my secrets and obey the norm.He was a short sophomore. He joked a lot about how many women he had been with and how much of a gentleman he was to each and every one. The girl I went to the party with was my crush. We had both been secretly seeing each other, lurking in the darkness of dorm rooms, frat houses, and back seats of cars. We both knew we were different, but we had not yet formed the language or the self-love for ourselves to claim it.That night, cold and damp, was harder than most. I was becoming more and more angry by the second it seemed as I kept choking down the words of “I’m gay, but I’ll get over it...” because it started to feel entirely wrong. Thank you, Jesus.So, that night as a 19-year-old college student I got hammered and came out to a few in the room as the party died. Let’s name the room, as if it was the game Clue.Short SophomoreGirl CrushTwo sorority sisters (yes, I did that)And, a guy I considered at the time to be a good friendImmediately, the room shifted from giggles, chugging cheap beer to Oh my God what?! This was the first time I experienced questions of Why, How, When, It’s a phase… and so many other questions that brought forth the bold statement But, I can turn you straight.A few hours later, I came out of a black haze to darkness. But, this time it wasn’t to act out my girl crush curiosity — to my horror I was becoming another victim of sexual assault. I woke up, pushed short sophomore off of me, and ran from the house.Blindsided, confused and utterly freezing, I wandered up a street calling one person over and over again who knew — she knew I was not this.It was 3 AM when I finally got a ride home.The next day was a funeral procession of friends holding, consoling and never once saying a word. We all conformed to remaining silent.What came next was a wave of guilt and shame.He went on to joke about turning the lesbian straight. He bragged about how bad “I wanted it” and how he achieved the goal he set out for proving I wasn’t gay. For the rest of that year I tried harder than ever to be straight.It would take me 9 years through the process of coming out, learning my person, and reclaiming my faith in God and relationship with Christ to understand that this incident was not my fault.creditAnd, I’m sharing this for two reasons:After the #metoo movement began I knew that this part of my testimony had been missing from the story I share and it pressed upon me to explore sharing it.It wasn’t until I read Steph Grant’s story, that I began to process that other queer women have probably faced what I have and need to know they are not alone.Here is what I have come to believe:For me personally, I know my identity is rooted in my relationship with Christ, but within that relationship are all the pieces that God carefully/thoughtfully placed together to build me. There is no other you and there is no other story like yours. By design, we were born into our own unique characteristics, gifts, and faithful ways to live a life designed by love.Christ teaches us to build our home upon him — the rock. But, we still have the job of building the frame, the rooms and the decor that makes up our home. This is ever-changing, as we are ever-changing in how we ask questions, view God and participate in a relationship with our foundation. (Matthew:24–29)But, for some, we’ve been shown the floor plan of someone else’s house and it is not our own or unique to us. We have been shown and told to stay here in the parlor until called upon.The moment I decided to examine my home is the moment I began to develop not only self-love toward my sexuality as a piece of my personhood, but developed a true, intimate relationship with Christ. We were busy asking questions like, “Do we really need this picture in this hallway?” aka “Do you need this abuse in your life? Show me where it hurts?”This is how we begin to leave the dependent nature of dark club walls, dark spaces, and the shadows where we are living our secrets — whether that is being queer or not.“But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another..”Light your home. Paint the walls. Explore every inch of the house you have been building. And, ask Christ to show you where it hurts & I assure you he will not only do that — he will help you heal and see anew again.These words are not my own. These are the words that belong to my Father who has created us all in his loving image and asks us simply to live into the love we were born through — amen.Peace to you all.Follow Rachael: Twitter | Instagram | www.queerinfaith.comReaching Out is a publication dedicated to gathering LGBTQ stories from people of all faiths under one roof and around one table.Follow on Instagram | Twitter | FacebookLGBTQMetooSexual AssaultReaching OutStorytellingOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Rachael WardNavigating Uncomfortable & Comfortable Spaces within Queer Inclusion & Reformation of Being. @queerinfaith / www.queerinfaith.comReaching OutLGBTQ stories of faith lost & found\n",

      "prefix=item.html_text, event=string, value=Joyce BowenJul 3, 2017The PlagueIt is the third day of June in this the year of our Lord, 1348 in the city Florence of Italy. The heat is not yet enough to tempt the opening of the windows. I am grateful, for every day the streets fill with the bodies of those having died during the night — and sometimes from the night before or the night before that. Carcasses, no matter what their position in the community, smell much the same in the full bloom of day.I have cared for my young mistress for the seventeen years of her life. Her family has cared for me all of mine. If she survives, she will never be the same innocent I held to my breast in her infancy. Death has touched her and made her beautiful, grey eyes shallow pools with no reflection. She sits by the window and stares at the garden left untended since my son died of the pestilence. It has been this way since the death of the last of her loved ones — her betrothed. It was a love match to be sure, and a more handsome, kind youth I have not known since the younger days of my boy. I am too old for the horror, the screams, the revelry, and the madness. I am tired and afraid; not for myself, but for the child.Enough of self-pity and what is past. I will leave soon to fetch the urine of the virgin daughter of my friend who lives near Ponte Vecchio: a covered bridge lined with deserted shops where goldsmiths sold their wares just a short while ago. Every day I bathe my mistress in warm water laced with urine to ward off the sickness. The doctor said any urine, though not of a relative, would do. The rumor of my grandmother’s great love for one of the old masters and his for her makes me hesitant to use my own. The virgin’s water is pure; and when my mistress’ mother became ill, my son bade her drink a mix of herbs and the water. She wore a bag of defecation about her neck. It did not save her, but I pray that using these things before the sickness can set in with the girl will prevent it from doing so. I find it hard not to reflect on the horrors of yesterday. It is, perhaps, better than surmising about what is yet to come.As I leave my home, I see a group of bechini — men who bear the bodies of the dead to their final resting-place — just up the street. I know I must settle back into the stone doorway, or they will take the offerings I carry for the virgin’s mother. But no — look, they are occupied with Maria’s daughter — poor thing. Maria is standing near the side entrance. We both watch as the jocular bechini stroll through the gate: one with his arm around the sobbing girl’s shoulder, the other with his arm encircling her waist, nuzzling her slender neck. The girl pulls away from one man only to move into the other. Her long brown hair sways with the effort. Maria is making no move to protest, and in short order, I see why: Her husband lies dead on a slab a short distance from the front doorway, a beautifully embroidered tablecloth covering his body up to his nose as if death could be denied by this simple act of exposure. As I move from the doorway, Maria’s tormented gaze meets mine, and I understand. She wrenches her gaze from me, and I know the price for the bechinis’ services becomes dearer each day.The longer I am out here, the weaker my stomach is becoming from the smells and the debauchery. I find it hard not to stop to vomit as I quicken my steps to avoid meeting others. To stop for something so trivial could bring disaster. But no, I will the bile rising in my throat back to its chamber and continue on my way to Ponte Vecchio: “The Bridge of the Dead Goldsmiths.” I clap my hand painfully over my mouth to stifle a titter over the thought of such a gruesome epithet for the beautiful bridge. Flesh meets flesh, hand to face, and moisture spits painfully into the center of my eye as it returns to its source. I find myself envying my young mistress’ senseless state, and worse still the dead, in my anguished reunion with the outside world.Ahead gathers a chanting crowd in the Piazza Della Signoria. On reaching the people on the outskirts, I learn that the Council of Eight has announced the arrival of a group of flagellants. They are moving across the bridge as we speak, and I am deterred from going farther. I know if I do not join the crowd, I may be condemned by their Master as a heretic and burned alive for my trouble. I begin to sway with the others, moving closer towards my goal as I croon the words in harmony with the voices around me:“God will save us.We repent our sins.Pain will cleanse us.Now it begins.”But I am past the days of believing that watching a collection of fools scourging themselves with spike-tipped whips to the point of bloody unconsciousness will save us.I have found my way into the alley where the home of my friend waits with the precious liquid. The alley is cobbled with flat gray stones. Every few steps, I move one way or the other to avoid treading on some poor soul left to rot or be eaten by the hogs. The tears return, but now it is not sadness that brings them: It is the acrid smell of decomposing flesh. Again, I choke down the bile mixed with the remnants of my last crude meal as I stand in front of the door I have been seeking. I enter uninvited as agreed and am struck by the thought that the smell is no less inside than out. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I see them huddled in the corner. The child’s head rests on her mother’s breast — her once blue eyes bleached white by death. Isabel, her mother, looks to have died sometime after her daughter, and I wonder if it was not from a broken heart, rather than the pestilence. As I draw a piece of coarse linen over what is left of them, I know God has forsaken us all. I will go home now — to die with my child. That will give me some solace. If she dies before me, a dose of gentle poison will do. If God strikes me sick before her, there will be enough for us both.Copyright 1999 Joyce Bowenhttps://www.bebee.com/@joyce-bowenhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/joyce-bowen/https://twitter.com/crwriter1https://joycebowen.wordpress.com/author/joycebowen/https://medium.com/@joycebowenAbout the Author: Joyce Bowen is a freelance writer and public speaker.

Understanding the implications of this are critical in understanding bitcoin.This originally appeared as a reddit post by /hodlgentlemen. All words were originally written by him. It was such a great analysis that I thought it had to be shared with Medium.People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them.All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create.From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make.This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure.What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2009. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.If you want to follow blogs like Y Combinator, Marc Andreessen, Andrew Chen, & more check out our mobile app Playbook.

If you haven’t heard of it, it lets you save any articles you come across online and read them later in the app, only with all distracting elements and visual noise (like popups, navigation and ads) removed, and with nicely-formatted text.On top of that, all non-essential in-app UI elements, such as the status and navigation bars, fade away as you start reading. It’s basically the closest you’ll get to a paper book on your phone in terms of a focused reading experience:Pocket’s Auto-Fullscreen mode in actionRecently I’ve starting working on an app for StarCraft II strategies. The app is relatively text-heavy and seemed to be a good match for this kind of feature, so I thought I’d have a go at building it.Although definitely doable, getting everything to work seamlessly involved a decent amount of reading (and re-reading) of different blog posts and documentation, and a fair bit of trial-and-error. It took a while until certain parts “clicked” — particularly how android:fitsSystemWindows works.OutlineThis guide aims to make all of that more accessible, and hopefully save you time and frustration if you’re looking to build something similar. It’ll assume no more than a mid-beginner level of experience with Android development.We’ll build a Pocket-like distraction-free reading experience with an iterative approach, starting with a basic activity layout, and adding distraction-free features, one at a time.Part I (this article) will set up an app with some basic distraction-free features; if you’re an experienced developer with an existing app you might want to jump straight to Part II where we look into fitsSystemWindows to implement the more advanced features.If you get stuck, there’s a link to the full source code for this part at the end of the article.Onward…What we’re going to buildA basic article view with a Toolbar on top, a translucent system navigation bar and a Floating Action Button (FAB) to make things a bit more interesting.When the user scrolls down the article, the Toolbar, system bars and FAB (“chrome” collectively) will animate away all at once.Scrolling up will animate the chrome back in.Additional constraints to further reduce distractability:The text content should not jump or snap in any way when the chrome animates in or out. Chrome should fade away seamlessly, without disrupting the user.It should never be necessary for the user to trigger auto-hiding of chrome in order to read all parts of the article. In other words, it should still be possible to read the entire article even if chrome happened to get stuck in a permanently-visible state (this is actually related to the previous constraint — more on that later).Getting StartedLet’s dive in. Open up Android Studio and create a new project with a blank activity.ThemeBy default your app’s theme will inherit from Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar which will automatically add an Action bar/Toolbar to your activity windows. We’re going to want to add the Toolbar to our Activity layout manually to precisely control its placement, so this isn’t what we want. Change your AppTheme to inherit from AppCompat’s NoActionBar theme instead:app/src/main/res/values/styles.xmlBuild DependenciesSince we want a FAB we’ll need to add a dependency on Google’s Design Support Library. Add this to the dependencies section of your app module’s build script:app/build.gradle:compile 'com.android.support:design:25.3.1'(Where 25.3.1 is the same version as the other support libraries in your build script — this might differ in your generated project)StringsWe’ll need some dummy article content for our reader activity, and enough of it to extend outside of the screen to make the view scrollable.Grab some Lorem ipsum text and paste it into your strings file as a new string resource:app/src/main/res/strings.xml:<string name=\"lorem\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ... </string>(This is also a good time to change your app_name string to something else if you feel so inclined).Initial Activity LayoutOpen up activity_main.xml and replace whatever’s in there with this:app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xmlA quick refresher on FrameLayoutSo what’s going on here is we have two full-size (i.e. width and height set to match_parent) view groups stacked on top of each other inside a root FrameLayout. The first view group is for the article text (the NestedScrollView) and the second is for the UI chrome (the inner FrameLayout).Due to their order in the root FrameLayout, the UI chrome layer will always be drawn over the text layer. One way to remember how FrameLayout works is to imagine it painting Views in the order they’re listed— the last-mentioned View will always be painted last, over top of everything else.Now you might be thinking this setup would result in the TextView being obscured by the Toolbar, violating constraint #2 from earlier. You would be right. To avoid that, the TextView’s top margin has been set to the default actionbar height, ensuring it will appear just below the bottom of the Toolbar when the activity first opens.Initial Activity CodeThere isn’t much code to write at the point, all we need to do is ensure some text is displayed in the Toolbar.Open up MainActivity.java and replace the default code with this:app/src/main/java/<com.yourpackagehere>/MainActivity.javaThis will cause the Toolbar’s title to be whatever you chose for the app_name string.If you go ahead and Run (Ctrl+R on Mac) the app now you should see something like this:Our inappropriately-titled first versionThis isn’t exactly the embodiment of a distraction-free reading experience yet. Let’s start fixing that.Removing Distractions, One Step at a TimeDisappearing FABIt turns out hiding the FAB when the user scrolls is straightforward enough, so let’s start there. Jump back into editing MainActivity in Android Studio and add a new field for the FAB:private FloatingActionButton actionButton;The FAB has an id assigned in the activity’s layout XML, we can use that to find and save a reference to it in onCreate():@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);    actionButton = (FloatingActionButton) findViewById(R.id.fab);    setupToolbar();}We can use this reference to hide and show the FAB when needed in code. The next step is to actually do that at the correct times, namely, when the NestedScrollView is scrolled up or down.Listening out for Scroll direction changesNestedScrollView can have an OnScrollChangeListener set on it via its aptly-named setOnScrollChangeListener() method. This listener gives us all of the info we need (and then some!) to know whether to hide or show the FAB via its single callback method:void onScrollChange (NestedScrollView v,                 int scrollX,                 int scrollY,                 int oldScrollX,                 int oldScrollY)We happen to know that horizontal scrolling isn’t possible in our layout, so we can ignore scrollX and oldScrollX.scrollY and oldScrollY contain the absolute scroll positions for the view. What we’re interested in is not so much absolute values, but when the scroll direction changes. I.e. when the user begins scrolling down initially, and when they go from scrolling down (possibly intermittently) to scrolling up.In other words, we’re interested in when scrollY - oldScrollY (let’s call this yDelta) goes from zero or negative, to something positive, and vice versa.This implies storing an oldYDelta somewhere, and then comparing a newly-calculated yDelta against it each time there’s a scroll event. We could store this state in a field in the activity, but activities have a way of accumulating more and more variables and code until they become a confusing mess.This is a good opportunity to create a small, reusable class. In Android Studio, create a new abstract class called OnScrollDirectionChangedListener:app/src/main/java/<com.yourpackagehere>/OnScrollDirectionChangedListener.javaThis class encapsulates all of the logic and state needed to calculate scroll direction changes and surfaces it through a higher-level, easier-to-use interface — its onStartScrollingDown() and onStartScrollingUp() callback methods.Let’s make use of this in MainActivity and see how it looks. Jump back into MainActivity and add a new method called setupScrollView():private void setupScrollView() {    NestedScrollView scrollView =            (NestedScrollView) findViewById(R.id.nested_scrollview);        scrollView.setOnScrollChangeListener(            new OnScrollDirectionChangedListener() {                @Override                public void onStartScrollingDown() {                    actionButton.hide();                }                @Override                public void onStartScrollingUp() {                    actionButton.show();                }            });}Add a call to it in onCreate():@Overrideprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);    actionButton = (FloatingActionButton) findViewById(R.id.fab);    setupToolbar();    setupScrollView();}That’s all for the FAB. If you run the app (Ctrl+R) now you should find that the FAB shrinks away to nothing when you scroll down, and zooms back into existence when you scroll up. FloatingActionButton is unusual in that it comes with these animations out of the box — a nice touch by the library developers.Disappearing ToolbarSince we have a scroll listener set up, it’s not too much extra work to get the Toolbar to appear and re-appear as well.Now we could just set the Toolbar’s visibility to GONE on scroll down, and back to VISIBLE on scroll up, but having visuals instantly pop in and out isn’t a great user experience. Also, it would violate that part in constraint #1 about “chrome fading away seamlessly”.No, we can do better. Let’s actually animate it.The Toolbar class doesn’t come with built-in animations like FloatingActionButton, so we’ll add our own.We will create two new animation XML files in app/src/main/res/anim (create the directory first if it doesn’t exist) — one for animating the Toolbar out of view, and one for bringing it back in.Now jump back to MainActivity and create two new methods for hiding and showing the Toolbar using these animations:app/src/main/java/<com.yourpackagehere>/MainActivity.javaNote that we have to change the Toolbar’s visibility at the end and beginning of these animations via AnimationListeners. If we don’t do this, they will immediately return to their pre-animation states when the animations end. Remember: just because an animation causes a View to fade out, doesn’t mean the View will stay faded-out :)Add calls to these new methods from the same scroll direction callbacks we used earlier for the FAB:app/src/main/java/<com.yourpackagehere>/MainActivity.javaLet’s see how it looks now:Progress! We’re halfway to building a respectable Pocket clone (well… kindof).All that’s left are the system bars — the status bar on top and navigation bar on the bottom.We’ll tackle that in Part II by learning about fitsSystemWindows, window flags, decor views and other dark corners of the Android SDK.You can find the source code for Part 1 on github.Hope this helped, stayed tuned for Part II in this series!Further DiscussionQ: Why not use CoordinatorLayout + AppBarLayout from the design support library to hide the toolbar on scrolls?A: This is a valid question — the design support library provides an alternative way to do everything we’ve seen in the sample until now with a combination of CoordinatorLayout, AppBarLayout, NestedScrollView and custom Behaviors. It’s good to use existing solutions where possible to avoid reinventing the wheel, and in fact this is where I started. Ultimately however, I moved away from using CoordinatorLayout for a number of reasons.CoordinatorLayout + AppBarLayout gives you a lot of power and options for animating the Toolbar in response to scroll events. This includes having it scroll out of view in direct relation to scrolls on the text, rather than hiding with a fixed-duration animation. This is a nice effect, and if you want this it does probably make sense to use the library.However, you’ll notice that Pocket opts for a fixed-duration Toolbar animation. I think this makes sense given the goals for their app: if you want to hide all non-essential UI elements in an non-distracting way, it makes sense to have them all hide together at the same speed. In addition, for reading apps like this it makes sense to hide chrome as soon as possible once the user has indicated their interest in the text via scrolling, rather than letting it linger.As we’ve seen, setting up a scroll listener to run a fixed-duration animation on the Toolbar yourself is straightforward and requires very little code. It’s easy to see what’s going on, even to developers new to the platform.I don’t believe the same can be said about the CoordinatorLayout Behavior approach. If you’re anything like me and other Android developers I’ve worked with, you’ll find yourself referring back to documentation to understand the effect of the different app bar layout behaviors each time you encounter them. The names aren’t self-documenting.If and when you need to implement more complex animations in your layout in response to scroll events, the extra power offered by the library might be exactly what you need. For simple cases like this however, the trade-off in complexity and readability probably isn’t worth it.Remember the KISS and YAGNI principles.Q: What about just using a custom CoordinatorLayout Behavior to hide the FAB?Yes that can be done — the recommended approach was to use CoordinatorLayout as your root layout, create a new ScrollAwareFABBehavior class that extends FloatingActionButton.Behavior, setting it as the FAB’s layout_behavior in XML, and this will work fine.That is, it did work fine until v25.1.0 of the Design Support Library. This version introduced a breaking change whereby Views whose visibility is GONE would no longer received nested scroll events. This is true for FABs after hide() is called, meaning your FAB would hide once and never reappear.The recommended solution/workaround was to create a new Behavior for the scrolling view itself to iterate through all of the CoordinatorLayout’s child Views, checking if they’re FABs via runtime type-checking, and then animating them if they are.Even ignoring potential performance issues of this approach, I found this to be a needlessly complex and opaque solution when contrasted with simply calling hide() or show() on the FAB in a scroll listener.Thanks to Ariane Galope.

However, the woman at the forefront of it all was nothing as I’d imagined.I first got to know Sophia Amoruso, standing in her kitchen making herbal tea together. I expected a brash, loud spoken woman as the media had portrayed who believed “my way or the highway”. I was mistaken. Sophia was curious, open minded and asked many questions. She was passionate about how to drive forward her already large and truly engaged community.We spent hours, and several cups of tea, discussing the opportunities for Girlboss. I flew home that day truly inspired and called her that evening to say that Lightspeed would like to invest, as you can read about in today’s WSJ article.“You don’t get what you don’t ask for… asking and asking again goes really far” — Sophia AmorusoSophia is a repeat entrepreneur who started what went on to be Nasty Gal at the young age of 23. She learnt a lot from driving the company to over $300m in annual revenue. She learnt a lot more from the bankruptcy of the company. As someone who believes that you learn more from those events that don’t work out than those that do, I believe Sophia is in a strong position.Having authored the New York Times 18 week best seller book #GIRLBOSS, created the Podcast Girlboss Radio which now has half a million weekly downloads, launched a Netflix Girlboss series and even begun The Girlboss Foundation to give grants to young women entrepreneurs, there is little Sophia can not do.She is now running a media business, which really plays to her strengths and allows her to leverage her strong network and influencer status. This can be seen through the organic growth of the community and audience of 5.6m from their website, newsletter, social media, podcasts and Girlboss rallies (both in person and digital). The Girlboss community is big and growing fast.Topics on the Girlboss platform vary from work to wellness and from money to moisturizer. However, they are all ultimately focused on one main topic — female empowerment.“Focus on less things and be great at those things” — Sophia AmorusoSophia has already built up a strong executive team with Alison Koplar Wyatt as President and CRO and Neha Gandhi as COO and Editor in Chief. Alison and Neha combined have over 25 years experience working with both brands and media companies.I am excited to announce that Lightspeed will be leading the latest Girlboss financing and I will be taking a board seat in a company I strongly believe in.Girlboss inspirational quotesGirlboss plays into much of the theses and vision that we believe. A new generation of content companies is being formed, which is more authentic to their target demographic, Millennials and Generation Z. Snapchat, Cheddar and Mic are increasingly creating video content for this audience and seeing great success. Girlboss has a similar strategy for their digital streams, with a female Millennial and Generation Z audience. This audience is one that stands for female entrepreneurship and female empowerment.Investors look for businesses with strong network effects. I believe that brand can in itself be a core network effect. It is then community and content that give defensibility to the brand. Girlboss demonstrates all these characteristics. They have built up a community of millions of young women, who are helping one another and benefiting from the Girlboss content to give them the confidence to go in the direction of their dreams.Sophia Amoruso is a force to be reckoned with and there are many more strong female founders launching businesses around community and already finding great success. These are the strong founders that are shaping our future and I would love to meet. They too are Girlbosses.Giphy — Let’s all give one another a leg up☞ To hear more of my thoughts in the future, follow me on Twitter☞ If you liked this post, Please “clap” to help to promote this piece to others or let me know your thoughts in the comments.EntrepreneurshipMediaFemale FoundersVenture CapitalWomen In TechOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Nicole QuinnInvestor at Lightspeed, Stanford alum, Former Consumer Analyst at Morgan Stanley and British 100m sprinterLightspeed Venture PartnersLightspeed is an early stage VC firm focused on accelerating disruptive innovations and trends in the enterprise and consumer sectors.

East-Asian music, horror audio specialist.Nov 7, 2017What does Cultural Appropriation in Game Music sound like?Disclaimer:The audio discussed in this article is merely for analytical and discussion purposes. This is not a composer, developer, publisher or audience bashing post.I am Chinese-Thai, born and bred in London so my focus and knowledge lie mostly on East Asian topics.This is a part write up of my research into the topic, part document of a panel session and part post write up.Panelists included Jade ‘JDWasabi’ Leamcharaskul (composer / indie developer), Chris White(composer) and Claudia Haberburg (host)Check out #vgmusicalappropriation on Twitter for pics and tweets about the panel!Thanks Nemo Martin for proof reading!Nine Worlds 2016Earlier last month (August 2016) I had the pleasure of being invited to be part of the Nine Worlds 2016’s ‘Cultural Appropriation in Game Music’ panel; an open discussion on what it is, examples of it in Game Music and the affects it has on the game, the player and social impact. Socials issues within gaming and game music interest me, so I jumped at the opportunity to be on the panel. The lack of a diversity in the game industry is statistically awful and it is something I personally strive to change.Photo by Jade ‘JDWasabi’ LeamcharaskulFirst, to cover a few points to get everyone up to speed:WHAT IS GAME MUSIC?Music that works with several game design elements to enhance user experienceSets the narrative tone of the game and helps world buildingCommunicates to the player the relative emotions that a player should experience in a specific time/event within the game.Adds to the narrative flow.Creates emotional investment and a relationship between game and player.A lot of people that I’ve come across, particularly those who are new to game composition, seem to forget that game music is a design principle. The priority of game music is always the game, and in turn player experience. It is the job of the game composer to problem-solve and work with the developers to ensure that the game narrative is communicated effectively to the audience through the music.I could rant all day about this, but I’ll leave that to another post. Moving on.WHAT IS CULTURAL APPROPRIATION?To define:“It is the adoption or use of elements of one culture by members of another culture.”But this is a very basic explanation of what Cultural Appropriation (CA) is. There are other aspects to it which makes it problematic:The ‘adoption’ is often done without any kind of permission……and that element is morphed, stripped off its original meaning. This is insensitive to the original culture.The power dynamic between the dominant culture taking from an already oppressed subservient culture.Katy Perry’s ‘Unconditionally’ where she wears a costume which mixes Japanese and Chinese features.Examples of CA:“Cultural” halloween costumes like dressing up as ‘geisha dolls’ pretty much promotes East Asian fetishes and sexualises an aspect of that culture. (Why do some people insist on wearing chopsticks in their hair? Do you put forks in your hair? I think not.)Wearing Christian crosses on a shirt or wearing an Aum accessory because it’s hip and cool. Not because you’re a practicing religious person.My co-panelist also chimed in on this: Picasso became famous after being ‘inspired’ by African art. Despite being part of African culture for hundreds of, if not thousands of, years, African art styles suddenly became ‘new’ and ‘inspiring’ through this new medium, without being recognised as such.Similarly, Elvis Presley was dubbed the ‘King of Rock and Roll’ despite the genre’s roots in Rhythm and Blues, Gospel, Jazz and more, completely undermining POC (Person Of Colour) artists and originators, who get swept under the rug of pop culture. Jazz music itself, while great, has very problematic and historical roots, originating from African American communities during the slave trade and the colonisation of West Africa. Now its demographic is strangely elitist; generally enjoyed by the white upper-middle class. (https://infogr.am/has_blues_and_jazz_been_whitewashed)To quote a meme I read somewhere: “CA is like researching for a project, only for the teacher to grade you an F and grade the person who copied you an A.”WHY IS CA BAD?I will not dive into this one because there are a plethora of articles on this so I will link to a few instead. Mainly here and here and anywhere else Google suggests. CA is harmful, insensitive and perpetuates negative stereotypes. In a creative field, this makes the stories we tell increasingly bland and boring. Heroes look and sound the same. Archetypal tropes remain the same and the same kind of story continuously repeats.Surely if you want to be successful in the games industry, you’d want to work on delivering a fresh and amazing game narrative and experience?WHERE DOES GAME MUSIC COME IN?Now that we’re all up to speed, I can focus on documenting my journey on researching into this topic and anecdotes taken from the panel session.USES OF TRADITIONAL MUSICIntroducing “The Other”A common game narrative is the subject of “The Other”. The player is often thrown into new worlds and universal lores to explore, and a multitude of characters and/or things to emotionally invest in. The use of traditional cultural music helps embody that alien, other worldly feeling a player experiences. The sense of wonder and exploration is part of the magic of discovery.Instant history* lessons*And by history, it really means stereotypical tropes that everyone knows from pop culture.As a game music composer, using traditional cultural music elements can communicate a subconscious layer of history. A cultural ‘weight’ is carried within the music which a player instantly understands from conformed archetypal tropes in storytelling.For example, you’re in a desert level and Indian Raag-inspired music is playing. The audience immediately pictures bazaars, peddlers, thieving children and lots of sand- without the game having to do any work. The cherry on the top of the conjured imagery would be that a rich overlord has been financially exploiting the townsfolk; with just one piece of music and you already feel comfortable in the plot.Another example would be being in a jungle level. Cue “jungle” type music featuring drums, drums and more ethnic drums. You bump into a “native” NPC (non player character) who takes you to their tribal village and very often the music will be ‘exotic’ to show how ‘different’ this level and its inhabitants are. Away from ‘civilisation’, this other culture is primitive, but if western classical orchestral music started to play, the player would instantly be ‘taken out’ of the believability of the level.Humans are naturally hard wired to form meaning from something. The same goes in game design where players can form their own experiences based on nuggets of narrative information. As an audience, they’d have their own way of reading medium code, which is built from Hollywood, films, games, comics, pop culture and more. Game music is one of the many elements that help achieve (or break) this.Assassin’s Creed Chronicles China by Climax Studios, Published by Ubisoft (2015)AUDIO ANALYSIS 1 by JadePossible mis-appropriate/inappropriate cultural elements in Game MusicFinding good examples to analyse was actually pretty difficult. So in the next section I will focus on doing an audio analysis of specific games tracks.MAIN THEME — Aaron MillerAssassin’s Creed Chronicles: China (2015, Ubisoft)Dat Flute (Excerpt at 1:47)Assassin’s Creed is known to be historically accurate but strangely enough, has questionably historically inaccurate music. Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China takes place in the Ming Dynasty (specifically 1526 AD) which made it easy to figure out the contextual specification of the setting. I am not a traditional Chinese music expert, but I know enough of what to expect from this period of history.The first thing I noticed about the main theme was the performance technique used in the flute samples. It sounds very much like how the NohKan flute is performed in Japanese Noh theatre. Compare the playing style of Noh flute performed by Fujita-san, the 11th generation Master of the Fujita School of Noh Flute and the Assassin’s Creed track. Quite similar right?This creates a disconnect between the discerning listener (myself, who could tell the difference) as an audience, and the game. My experience didn’t make sense. My eyes say that I am in the Ming Dynasty, yet my ears tell me that I’m more in a classic Japanese theatre performance which potentially predates the Ming Dynasty. Noh / Nohgaku theatre often tells supernatural tales, with iconic masks representing ghosts, demons, women, children and old people. This image had nothing to do Shao Jun running around rooftops and stabbing people in the face with her foot.[If you really want to get into it, Nohgaku comes from Sarugaku which came from China to Japan in the 8th century. However, Chinese theatre has developed since, whereas classical Japanese theatre has remained unchanged since the 14th century. More on my other post here where I go in depth of how Nohgaku is supposed to be perceived as an audience and how ‘anti music’ it is from a Western music perspective.]Out of curiousity, I Youtube’d Ming Dynasty court music and found it to be utterly different. The instrumentation was different, the feel and mood was different, the scale and sound quality was different. Oh and we could look at Kunqu Chinese opera too! Just before the panel I had managed to do a week introductory course as SOAS University of London (School of Oriental and African Studies, a world leading institution for the study of Asia, Africa and the Middle East) and we specifically worked on this song. Looking back at it, this particular type of Chinese theatre developed during the Ming Dynasty too.Yes! This was the kind of thing I was expecting to hear for the soundtrack to be influenced by. I know that I’m comparing Youtube videos to the Main Theme which is incomparable, and a very narrow slice of traditional Chinese music, but I’m also referencing audioscapes I’ve encountered in other mediums: old kung fu films, Chinese opera shows, Chinese New Year Lion dances, my mum, etc. As a player, I was disappointed in the audio. I was wanting a semi-historically accurate audioscape to go alongside my semi-historically accurate adventure and instead I got disjointed mishmash of East Asian history.I dug deeper in Youtube finding the similarities between traditional Chinese and Japanese music. It’s definitely getting more difficult to differentiate between the two and how easy it can be to interchange between China and Japan (tip: please don’t do this anyway for historical reasons). I looked up the composer of Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China, half hoping to see an Asian composer and instead I read a white sounding name and see a white person in the picture. I am a little disappointed, yet not surprised and I begin to ask myself: can a white person write Chinese music?Before you pick up the torches and pitchforks, I am super aware that I’m assuming a lot of things about this composer. I have not contacted them, I have not verified the compositional intent behind the soundtrack, I am assuming this person is white and has no knowledge of traditional Chinese music based on their looks. I am being unfair and judgemental. However, the question still remains, and I needed something I have knowledge about to compare. This leads me to my next audio analysis.Dragon Fin Soup (2015) © Grimm Bros.AUDIO ANALYSIS 2 by JadePossible appropriate use of cultural elements in Game MusicThe next track I’ll analyse is one of my own tracks I’ve written. I can verify the intent behind each note and I know that I’ve written it in a way in which I’m hopefully as respectful as I can be to its original culture.PINKYWOOD FOREST — JDWasabi (Jade Leamcharaskul)Dragon Fin Soup (2015, Grimm Bros.)Compositional Goal: be Pan AsianI was tasked with writing a track for the sakura-esque/Asian dungeon level and it was obviously inspired by East Asia / Japan. I wanted to be specific with my writing so I asked questions on what kind of Asian music the developer wanted. After some discussion, they said that they didn’t want the music to be specifically Japanese. “So…Asian neutral?” “Yep.” Gotcha. Pan-Asian it shall be.Right, this is my speciality. I’ve been playing Javanese gamelan since 2007-ish and Japanese taiko (specifically hokuriku style) drums fully for the last three, maybe four years. Of course I’m going to incorporate a lot of elements from that, and more!The beginning of the track was mucking about with some Chinese guzheng and erhu samples alongside Gamelan gongs. The strings are meant to imitate the Chinese sheng instruments (reed instrument used in imperial courts/folk music) for tonal bedding. A Japanese shakuhachi flute adds to the bedding and plays the main melody at 0:40. I have to admit that at the the point of writing this, I had no previous knowledge of a shakuhachi and the melody itself was based purely on instinct by then. Don’t ask if this is musically accurate![To the person who asked about the flute sample, it was definitely a shakuhachi! I totally forgot the instrument during the panel but I’ve now managed to dig out my old project file to confirm.]At 1:09, I introduce a gamelan compositional technique; ‘mipil’ with interlocking pairs of notes on the strong and off-beat played on alternating gamelan samples. The guzheng and Japanese koto instruments have a little melody and counter-melody happening. The taiko jiuchi (underlying base rhythm in traditional folk music) build towards 2:00 and in 2:30 onwards, the guzheng and koto play in the style of mipil. Of course, I had to end this atmospheric piece with Tibetan singing bowls and a big gong before it loops back to the beginning.Oh God! Now that I’ve analysed my own music, am I culturally appropriating myself and others still? Is it really okay that I’ve mixed and matched all these Asian cultures? After voicing this concern about myself, an audience member praised me for at least properly researching the instruments and for me knowing the culture behind each. So, to the person who chimed in at that time…thank you! I highly appreciate your comment again.At this point the panel moved to Chris’ audio analysis of his own work on a project inspired by Slavic mythology.[Hopefully Chris will be able to write a more in-depth audio analysis on his work and experience to expand on. Once Chris isn’t busy and able to contribute, I shall update this article at a later date!]Reaction Guys / Gaijin 4Koma , a game’s success ultimately lives in the hands of the audienceHISTORICAL ACCURACY VS PANDERING TO THE MASSES VS FUNDINGA developer dilemmaAfter some discussion, the panel shifted to being about the audience themselves. Through comparing an audio sample of Slavic singing, Chris’s work (researched and closer to Slavic inspirations), The Witcher 3 (Hollywood version of Slavic music which sounds very different from sample) we encounter an interesting issue that the audioscape in The Witcher 3 is already been deemed ‘historically accurate’ by a member of audience (who is of Polish descent if I remember correctly).So far we have explored views as a composer and developer, but we’ve yet to discuss the audience, who plays a key role in this conversation. Our combined efforts of developer/composer mean nothing if we don’t deliver a product or gaming experience which is expected by the player. Uncovering this aspect adds another layer relating to the issue of CA in game music.As developers and composers we make games for specific user experiences which as an audience, that comes with a certain level of expectation.The moment we include something like what is perceived as the ‘wrong’ type of music, we break the gameplay immersion. This is bad game design and therefore a bad game product. The audience wouldn’t want to play anymore, they’re less interested in supporting the developer and some of us would rage over the internet about it. Does this mean we should we sacrifice a culturally accurate creation to mass appeal to an audience who has culturally inaccurate expectations?Not only that, as a composer there are usually severe creative limitations. We’d need to problem solve and have work arounds if/when the original source music does not suit the game. There is lack of time, lack of research and lack of funding. Very rarely will a composer get to immerse themselves in a new musical culture and become a professional in it for every game project. Or, have the necessary funds to involve a professional performer to work with us. We’d work with the resources and knowledge that we have, and if it does boil down to Wikipedia, Youtube and pop culture, then it has to do.In terms of CA in game music and how to be as respectful as possible, we have so many different types of people, elements and logistics to cater to to make a game successfully work.The AudienceThe Publisher / InvestorThe DeveloperThe ComposerThere are probably many other groups, but it’s already difficult to see where the Minority Culture can fit in this vicious ‘audience vs viable commercial product’ cycle. What we have are games teaching audiences about what to expect from cultures, producing audiences who expect games to give them certain versions of cultures because of previous games… and composers stuck repeating the same mistakes.In reality, the game in which we developers and composers work so hard for truly is at the end of the day, in the hands of the consumer.TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT HARMFUL?Perhaps I’m being picky and being that person. I know games aren’t meant to 100% realistic. I know why people play games: to be a hero, win and achieve all sorts of fantastic feats. It’s a form of escapism which is what makes the world of gaming so magical. But on the other hand, why can’t games educate, raise awareness and help others in the real world? Even if it’s at a subconscious level? Games like Grand Theft Auto, which are meant to tell stories based on gang culture reinforce harmful stereotypes, which leaks into real life. These games trivialise and dehumanise many different groups of people, which makes it harder to empathise with and see them as human.We don’t give audiences enough credit to criticize a product, yet the stakes are very often too high. Release a ‘bad game’ and the studio can go bust over night, which is why many publishers and developers play it safe and release another shoot ’em up featuring a middle aged, brown haired, white male clone. There will always be groups furiously typing on the internet that “GAMES ARE ART, WHY DON’T YOU TREAT IT SO”, yet also rage at critics to “LEAVE POLITICS OUT OF OUR GAMES.” This is exactly what this whole discussion is about. I am treating games as an art and questioning what it really represents in many different social, economic and creative angles. CA in game music may be a very specific problem, but it adds to an already damaging weight towards minorities.Yes, we can be certainly be light hearted and make memes about the initial problem, but I certainly feel that we should be doing much more in supporting diversity in games by creating more diverse games.Closing down the session, there were still many unanswered questions:Who do we ask for permission if the originator isn’t remembered or if the originator is a community from history?Is “Pan-Asian” less bad when writing culturally specific Fantasy / Scifi games that aren’t set on Earth?What if the developer doesn’t know and cultural bias is already in place at the development stage?I can’t really answer those questions, but I do know that not providing the opportunity or a voice for a minority group at all can be harmful. By continuing to allow our games to be saturated in stereotypes, we are being told to stop seeing people of colour as people, but as NPCs in a world where a white protagonist may interact with, and potentially be on good terms with them, but who is ultimately superior to and, ironically, individual compared to them.AAA games often feature brown haired, 30-something white males leads in a narrative. How often do they feature female, POC, LGBT+ or a combination to lead the narrative?FINAL THOUGHTS“Can a white person write Chinese music?”I realised I never did answer this question. The answer is “yes”.This question was never implying that a composer is not allowed to write music based off another culture. We briefly discussed the negative effects of CA and how it can be such a grey area to deal in game music and within the game industry. It is by no means an easy problem to solve.In an ideal world and situation, we would want to create an opportunity of true cultural exchange. This means approaching cultural topics in a sensitive way and with no sense of entitlement or established power systems. It means giving the cultural minority a voice, more opportunities and actively working with them to ensure that they a represented in a positive/correct way that they see fit.As a game music composer, we can certainly help provide more opportunities for cultural exchange and create a more diverse industry. There are approximately 10,300 people currently making games in the UK. 19% are female yet only 4% are BAME (Black/Asian/Minority-Ethnic) which is down from last year. Obviously there is room for lots of improvement and potential cultural exchange.To quote a developer friend, he spent ages trying to get actual Native American music for his game and found a record company who specialises in licensing out music from Native American artists. They act like a liason for artists and asked around if several artists were interested on working on the game. Unfortunately nothing came about from that point of contact, so he bought some Native American music from a general music library as an alternative.On the other hand, I’ve had a few hilarious, less-positive responses when raising the topic of CA in game music in different composer groups. In one particular group, I was being described in a range of derogatory terms, had instant dismissals and elevated displays of entitlement. It was just sad to see people readily turning a blind eye to the issue and not wanting to create an open industry.So there are developers out there who are willing to reach out and create opportunities, and composers who are adamant about not caring.Perhaps a solution would be to compile an easy to access and developer friendly music library that features cultural/traditional music as well as providing a database of musicians, artists and consultants who specialises in it. The more dialogue that happens with composers and artists, the more opportunities are created to diversify the industry.In reality, this comes to a similar conclusion another panel I attended at Nine Worlds: #GamesSoWhite. Make the games industry more accessible to diversify it. Make diversity matter, otherwise kids start to see racial stereotypes as the norm. Call out things and openly support diverse projects as an audience participant. Even if it’s satire, change the fact that the stereotype is still there in your head.Enjoy the games and celebrate the critique.Originally posted on wasabi-playground.com , edited for Medium.comCultural AppropriationGamesMusicPop CultureComposerOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Jade LeamcharaskulGame music composer ‘JDWasabi’.

      "prefix=item.html_text, event=string, value=Ray CrowellEvangelist @humbleventures | Lover of people, food & beverage | Globetrotter | Attempted innovator & entrepreneurOct 24, 2017Can Smart City Challenge Partnerships Impact Economic Inclusion?Source: PixabayPart I: What makes Columbus, Ohio a role model?At the end of 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) launched a Smart City Challenge, requesting mid-sized cities across the nation to share ideas of how to create an “integrated, first-of-its-kind smart transportation system that would use data, applications, and technology to help people and goods move faster, cheaper, and more efficiently.”In just the span of a year, the department leveraged ~$350M in public-private funds for smart mobility technology advancements. During this challenge $40M from the DOT and $10 million from Vulcan, Inc., a Paul G. Allen Company was awarded to Columbus, OH with an additional $65M in grants awarded to “community-driven advanced technology transportation projects to cities and four additional challenge finalists of 78 applicants from across the country.Why Columbus above more notable tech-towns like Austin, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh you may ask?According to the USDOT Smart City Challenge report, “Columbus put forward an impressive, holistic vision for how technology can help all residents move better and access opportunity.” Their implementation vision is illustrated below.Columbus Smart City Challenge Implementation Vision“Transportation is not just about roads, transit and ride sharing. It’s about how people access opportunity. And how they live.”— Mayor Andrew J. GintherColumbus Mayer, Andrew J. Ginther summed up why Columbus was the winner. It’s more than just the novelty of connected technologies. All cities should start with evaluating access to opportunity. While there’s not a lot of data to support Columbus as a benchmark, cities should at a minimum be taking note at how they’ve spun off Smart Columbus from the Department of Public Service, paired up with the Columbus Partnership, and what is generated from the Idea Foundry in Franklinton. Leading indicators of their success is the focus on sustainability beyond the four-year grant commitment. They’ve already secured $500M from other commitments and partnerships.This challenge is one of many of late led by not only the government, but also corporate brands like Audi and Ford. If done well, I believe these initiatives could break the mold on the reality that commercialization and innovation can have negative effects on society due to the velocity of decision making while breaking existing constraints.Part II: What are the challenges to smart city implementation?So, as these programs become more popular, what are the public risks involved and how do we ensure a continuity of collaboration with high turnovers and competing political agendas in both government and corporate leadership?In the TED Talk, How a start-up in the White House is changing business as usual, Haley Van Dyke poignantly articulated the fears many have with technology adoption,“This growing dichotomy between the beneficiaries of the tech revolution and those it’s left behind is one of the greatest challenges of our time.”Smart city technologies can break down social and physical barriers and enable marginalized citizens to participate more freely. When we look at the problems worth solving (i.e. those that can be monetized) and those that can improve lives, we need to address the systemic challenges associated with districts that remain inaccessible, resource deserts, disproportionately less health and lifecare, and silenced overall.So, what are some of the things we can do to ensure more equitable beneficiaries emerge during this smart evolution in the future of cities? In a POTUS report, Technology and the Future of Cities, the authors highlight:“Technologies can help districts to be more equitable and inclusive as long as those goals are built in from the beginning and equity metrics are used as part of the measurement of success.”Fundamentally, we must develop measurement processes that reinforce the partnerships behaviors and capacities to enhance vitality and adaptability.Part III: What can existing doctrine teach us?In a 1995 Harvard Business Review article on Leading Change: Why transformation efforts fail, Kotter provides some wisdom with how we might grapple with the vitality and cognitive complexities that are these future of cities public-private partnerships:1) Establish a sense of Urgency2) Form a powerful guiding Coalition3) Create a Vision and strategies for change4) Communicate vision and lead by example5) Empower others to act to fulfill vision6) Plan for and create Visible, Short-term Wins7) Leverage Progress for more change8) Institutionalize new approachesWhen we consider adaptation, especially with the rapid pace of technological discovery and introduction to the masses, these elements would be wise to consider:1) Establish values and priorities2) Recognize and Maintain that the situation has changed3) Leverage Creativity to generate options (and allow enough time)4) Analyze Risk (interpret probable outcomes)Not all measurements are created equal. Measurements must be based on priorities and serve as a valid proxy for the objective/outcome. In the June 1999 edition of the Journal for Strategic Performance Measurement, Margaret Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers produced these five great insights in What Do We Measure and Why? Questions About The Uses of Measurement:1) Who gets to create the measures?2) How will we measure our measures?3) Are we designing measures that are permeable rather than rigid?4) Will these measures create information that increases our capacity to develop, to grow into the purpose of the organization (or partnership)?5) What measures will inform us about critical capacities: commitment, learning, teamwork, quality, and innovation?Part IV: Where do we go from here?No doubt, economic inclusion can be a byproduct of all these emerging technology deployments and smart city initiatives. It requires a shared vision, inclusive collaboration, and leadership. Here are some parting thoughts I’ll flesh out later in blog posts to come. If you prefer one over the other, please comment and I’ll address accordingly.1) We must create opportunity networks from participant networks associated with these challenges.2) We should take advantage of the weaving of exclusivity and reputation-based “institution” branding of the challenges to generate reverence-enriching motivation that cross-pollinates and develops true community of practice “influencers”.3) We need to take into consideration the economic fault line patterns attributed to the long-term loss of economic opportunity in our communities.4) We have to ask ourselves have citizens advanced from the time of Michael J. Weiss’ 1988 book, The Clustering of America:“Throughout the nation, Americans live in distinctive community types, refusing to blend into the mythical melting pot.”5) Designer-activists Emily Pilloton and Matthew Miller, founders of Project H Design have made amazing gains in the poorest county of North Carolina with these principles I whole heartedly believe should be the civic “design-hack” model:a) Design through Actionb) Design With, not forc) Design Systems, not stuffd) Document, Share, and Measuree) Start Locally, and scale globallyf) BuildSmart CitiesInclusionInnovationGovernmentTechnologyOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Ray CrowellEvangelist @humbleventures | Lover of people, food & beverage | Globetrotter | Attempted innovator & entrepreneurhumble venturesStories and lessons by founders and partners of humble ventures\n",

      "prefix=item.html_text, event=string, value=Joseph WillenJul 3, 2017What Will The NBA Look Like in 5 Years?Three scrubs…and the guy who led the league in deflectionsIn a span of five years, the entire landscape of the NBA can change. Five years ago, LeBron James’ Miami Heat were atop the NBA. The Warriors were a lottery team. In just five years, teams can go through the entire rebuilding process. Players can go from being potential stars to bonafide superstars. They can also change from stars to washed up players with outrageously large contracts (AKA members of the Knicks). Take a look into my crystal ball as I reveal who’ll top of the NBA ranks five years from now.Tier One:This tier is one of championship contenders.Golden State Warriors:PG: Stephen CurrySG: Klay ThompsonSF: Kevin DurantPF: Draymond GreenC: Jordan BellRole Players: McCaw, Looney, JonesThe Warriors earn this ranking despite the fact that, five years from now, their core four will be between 31 and 33 years old. Their team is comprised of some of the best players in the NBA, all of whom should age better than one might expect of the average player. The Warriors may not be title favorites, but with playoff experience in their big four, and young talent in McCaw, Looney, and Bell, they still have enough depth to seriously challenge any team five years down the road.Milwaukee Bucks:PG: Malcolm BrogdonSG: Khris MiddletonSF: Giannis AntetokounmpoPF: Jabari ParkerC: Thon MakerRole Players: Dellavedova, SnellTeam Giannis is for real. Antetokounmpo is surrounded with a plethora of talent built for the future of the NBA. With young 3-and-D players like Brogdon, Middleton, and Tony Snell, the Bucks’ insanely athletic and incredibly stingy defense should only get better. Outside of Giannis, Milwaukee needs more playmaking, which they could eventually obtain from Jabari Parker. This is a very well rounded team that could very well be hoisting up the Larry O’Brien trophy in 2022.Sidenote: If Thon Maker manages to approach (or reach) his full potential, the Bucks will be just that much closer to locks for championship contention; however, there remains the very real possibility Thon becomes a bust.Philadelphia 76ers:PG: Markelle FultzSG: Nik StauskasSF: Ben SimmonsPF: Dario ŠarićC: Joel EmbiidRole Players: Okafor, Covington, Luwawu-CabarrotUnless you’ve been living under a rock, you know that Sam Hinkie, former general manager of the 76ers, did nothing short of revolutionizing front-office strategy by trading away almost his entire team team in exchange for picks and young assets, in order to help create a superteam in the future. Unfortunately, Hinkie is no longer the 76ers GM, but his process, and the players it birthed remain. A frontcourt of Simmons and Embiid would work perfectly, but Šarić is simply too good not to plug into the starting lineup. Many want the Sixers to trade Okafor, but they have close to no leverage for dealing him, considering teams recognize the stockpile of bigs they have and the direction the league is heading in. However, the Okafor situation isn’t all bad. When the 76ers are eventually contenders, Okafor could have an Enes Kanter type of role off the bench. He certainly isn’t going to be what he many projected him to be coming into the league, but he will provide them surefire scoring off the bench, and that’s all this superteam needs.Minnesota Timberwolves:PG: Jeff TeagueSG: Jimmy ButlerSF: Andrew WigginsPF: Gorgui DiengC: Karl-Anthony TownsRole Players: Jones, MuhammadAs of July 6th, 2017, the T-Wolves have traded Ricky Rubio to the Jazz for a 2018 first and have signed Jeff Teague. In five years, they’d have a 32-year-old Butler and 34-year-old Teague (assuming both re-sign), causing the Wolves to have two players whose careers would be on the downswing. However, having both 27-year-old Andrew Wiggins and 26-year-old Karl-Anthony Towns should vault them into the conversation of serious contenders. Towns is part of the NBA’s new “unicorn” movement, and Wiggins is a scoring machine. The only issue with this team — it’s very top heavy. If the T-Wolves front office can make some savvy moves to shore up their bench, they could be seriously set as a legitimate dynasty.Tier Two:Tier two contains the teams that should land anywhere between the third and fifth seed in their respective conferences.Sacramento Kings:PG: De’Aaron FoxSG: Buddy HieldSF: Justin JacksonPF: Skal LabissièreC: Willie Cauley-SteinRole Players: Papagiannis, Mason, Richardson, GilesThis past draft should provide some long-overdue hope for Kings fans. They made many positive moves, and have a very talented young team. De’Aaron Fox has the potential to be something really special. In Fox many see a John Wall-esque player. Fox is an athlete with top-tier speed and excellent court vision. Hield is a deadeye shooter. Justin Jackson is an extremely hard worker who should develop into a quality three and D player. One issue the Kings have is that their big-man situation remains a bit unclear. Cauley-Stein and Labissière are both incredibly talented, but they play the same position. Papagiannis has potential. It seems Sacramento will have a hard time developing all of them at once. What puts Sac-town in tier two, and not tier one is the health of Harry Giles. If he develops well, they could be a borderline contender for the title, but without noticeable improvement out of the 20th pick, they’re sure to find themselves in the three to five seeded region.Editor’s note: If Papagiannis is as good as papa Papagiannis thinks he is, we’re in for one wild ride.Boston Celtics:PG: Isaiah ThomasSG: Gordon HaywardSF: Jayson TatumPF: Jae CrowderC: Ante ŽižićRole Players: Bradley, Brown, Smart, Rozier, Smart, YabuseleWhen I first wrote this, I’d drafted an entire section bashing Danny Ainge’s inability to sign a single star. Then, he goes out and signs Gordon Hayward. Granted, in 2022, Hayward will be 32 years old, slightly changing the complexion of this team. Bradley likely becomes a bench player, and the Celtics could potentially lose him in free agency. They have and will continue to have a massive logjam at the guard spots. Even if IT4 doesn’t age well, Boston will still have Hayward, Smart, Bradley, Rozier to fight it out for the 1 and 2 positions. Having a logjam isn’t all a bad thing, it means competition for the position, and in five years they are bound to have found their best guy. Boston has lots of young talent and future draft picks that they are destined to be at the very least the three seed or higher, but without a legitimate superstar (yet) I can’t put them in the top tier.Portland Trail Blazers:PG: Damian LillardSG: C.J. McCollumSF: Maurice HarklessPF: Noah VonlehC: Zach CollinsRole Players: Swanigan, Nurkic, CrabbeThis Portland Team has loads of potential at all positions. They have a legitimate superstar in Damian Lillard, and a star second scoring option in C.J. McCollum. However, these two are going to need a strong defense behind them if they want to become serious contenders. Harkless, Vonleh, and Collins would all be great fits behind the secondary splash bros; However, offensively, this lineup wouldn’t give them much spacing. That’s where Crabbe and Swanigan come in. Caleb Swanigan shot 44.7% from three and 78.1% from the charity stripe. Using a metric that projects three-point percentage for college basketball player based on historical data and college stats, Swanigan should have around a 38.9% three-point percentage. Swanigan also showcased his ferocious rebounding ability at Purdue, pulling down 12.5 rebounds per game in his last season for the Boilermakers. Allen Crabbe is already a proven commodity who has shown steady improvement each year in the league. He is a knockdown shooter who can play both the 2 and the 3 positions; He shot 44.1% from deep last year, and play completely adequate defense. In the 2017–2018 season, they won’t be challenging for anything other than a low playoff seed, but in five years they could be very close to serious championship contenders, if not quite there.Fact or Fiction: Is College Free Throw Percentage Better Than College Three Point Percentage at…A commonly held thought in NBA circles states that a college basketball player’s free throw percentage is a better…medium.comLos Angeles Lakers:PG: Lonzo BallSG: Jordan ClarksonSF: Brandon IngramPF: Julius RandleC: Ivica ZubacRole Players: Nance Jr.This Lakers projection is banking on them scoring big in free agency some time in the near future. While their current team is young and definitely possesses loads of talent, it also is one that lacks direction. Is this team waiting for a big free agent signing in 2018, or are they building for 2022? As of right now, the Lakers lack floor spacers and rebounding. They have an interesting young team and tons of cap space, but they can’t be considered a potential dynasty until they have a single direction.Phoenix Suns:PG: Eric BledsoeSG: Devin BookerSF: Josh JacksonPF: Marquess ChrissC: Dragan BenderRole Players: Knight, Warren, LenA great young team with loads of potential. The Suns have all the makings of a future dynasty, with so many talented second options and one offensive leader. Devin Booker has been likened to Kobe Bryant ever since his 70 point game, and has backed it up, having 14 games the 2016–2017 season of 30+ point outbursts. He needs to better his efficiency a bit, but things are looking up for the young gun. If Booker becomes even 2/3 the player Kobe was, this team is sure to be title contender. But one player isn’t enough. Every star needs a strong supporting cast, and he certainly has one. Josh Jackson is a athletic, defensive wing who should take the toughest assignments on defense, giving Booker a break. If Jackson manages to develop his shooting and continues to improve upon his already exceptional finishing around the basket, the two could form a lethal partnership. Eric Bledsoe also is a very talented defender, who has made great improvements offensively. Granted, Bledsoe will be 32 years old (and maybe not even on the Suns) in 2020, but he should be a serviceable veteran to have on the team. Marquese Chriss struggled in his first year in the NBA, but there will always be a place in this league for bigs who can shoot, and it seems likely that is what he’ll develop into. Similarly to Chriss, Dragan Bender struggled in his first year, shooting 27.7% from three. Their only other option is Alex Len,who thus far has proved to be a perpetually average backup center. If any of these players can fulfill their NBA potential, then this team could realistically compete for an NBA championship, but there are too many “ifs” on this team to realistically be put in the first tier, and as of right now they are not close to the level they need to be at.Tier Three:This is the tier of teams that have, for one reason or another, the ability to jump into one of the top two tiers, even if it seems unlikely. Whether it be a coach, GM, or star player, each of these teams had to make the list.New York Knicks:James Dolan will always ruin the Knicks hopes of being a successful franchise. With that fact out of the way, take a moment. Imagine a world where the Knicks are playoff contenders. Where Kristaps Porzingis has a good supporting cast. Where Frank Ntilikina proves all of New York wrong. Where Stephen A. Smith is happy. Unfortunately for fans, this doesn’t seem to be the reality for the Knicks’ future. Poor decisions in the past have put the Knicks in a hole that, while not impossible to get out of, is at the very least improbable. If they want to compete, they’ll need to do just about everything right, which will take quality moves to cut cost and the willingness to suck for a few years.Frank Ntilikina: Mysterious Rwandan-Belgian-Frenchman and Knicks SaviorFrank Ntilikina (nee-LEE-kee-na, you’re welcome). The 18 year old question mark. The kid that didn’t work out for a…medium.comSan Antonio Spurs:Generally, betting against Pop and the Spurs is a bad idea. An argument could be made the Spurs will always be a top tier team. But this past year, they showed an over reliance on Kawhi Leonard and dismissiveness of other young players which doesn’t bode well for their future. In five years, Leonard will be 31. If (or maybe, when) Pop can come up with another superstar with a middle-to-late first round pick, the Spurs could be vaulted into contention, but as of right now, it seems there‘s little to no chance (But hold out hope for Dejounte Murray).New Orleans Pelicans:Up until very recently, the Pelicans front office had consistently failed to surround Anthony Davis with comparable talent. However, the current “Big Three” of Davis, Demarcus Cousins, and Jrue Holiday could be able to do big things in a few years. It’ll be interesting to see if the Cousins-Davis combo will actually work in the modern NBA. They are both match up nightmares offensively, but transition defense could be an issue if two of their big three aren’t hustling back. In five years, Cousins will be 31, Holiday will be 32, and Davis will be 29. If the Pelicans’ front office can surround these players with quality three and D guys, they could realistically be a high tier two team.Cleveland Cavaliers:LeBron and Kyrie. Will they age well? It’s never smart to doubt Lebron, but his minutes and physical exertion seem to push the boundaries of human athleticism, and we are left to wonder just how much longer he can go. Will Kyrie manage to maintain his performance, even as he begins to take on a larger role? If they continue to perform well with time, and the Cavs add an athletic scoring wing, they could be right in the thick of things, just as Lebron’s teams have been for the better part of the last decade.NBAPhiladelphia 76ersBasketballMilwaukee BucksMinnesota TimberwolvesOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Joseph WillenPush The PaceSports BlogResponsesThe author has chosen not to show responses on this story.

With that, SMedian’s embeds are showing up more often than when I first introduced them a couple months ago, so I’d like their design to better compliment the work of the writers and publications who use them.For the sake of timelessness, the new designs below are simply images of the actual embeds. Under each image, you can click the link to see the embed in action.Writer Call to Action (CTA)The writer’s call to action embed is simply cleaner than before. It includes the writer’s chosen title, name, bio, call to action, and social links.View this embed in action. Writer: Abigail NwaochaWith Signup FormView this embed in action.If the writer would like to use his/her embed to capture emails from their readers, they can include a signup form in their CTA. Doing this will highlight the form submission button so that the reader is drawn to it more than the “Request to Contribute” button. All aspects of the form are customizable.Fully CustomizableYou can choose the button’s color and text, the image, title, message, and input placeholder. Once the reader submits their email, the form is replaced with a thank you message that you can fully customize:A customizable “thank you” note to new subscriber with a follow-up call to action. That’s a dancing cat :)You can choose the title, the message, and the image. You can even add a link for the reader to continue to; perhaps send them to your publication or give them a reward (free e-book, etc.) for signing up.How to GetLog into SMedian and go to your profile to set up your embed.Publication Call to Action (CTA)The publication call to action embed now shows more stats about the publication along with its main topic.Without Signup FormView this embed in action.Now, readers can see that the publication, Marketing & Growth Hacking in this case, focuses on Growth Hacking, has received 416 requests to contribute from writers, has 46,845 followers, and is growing by ~86 followers per day.With Signup FormView this embed in action.If the publication would like to use their embed to capture emails from their readers, they can include a signup form in their CTA.

I write tutorials about Laravel and Javascript http://connorleech.infoJan 10Know SQL in 2018Credit to xkcdAs a technical recruiter I came across many positions where SQL was a critical skill. To be a Business Analyst, Data Scientist, Backend Developer, Marketing professional or UX Design Researcher understanding SQL queries can be fundamental to your work.Let me back up. What is SQL anyway? SQL is a query language for talking to structured databases. Pretty much all databases that have tables and rows will accept SQL based queries. SQL has many flavors but the fundamentals stay the same. Professionals and amateurs alike use SQL to find, create, update and delete information from their sources of record. It can be used with a ton of different databases like MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server and Oracle. It powers the logic behind popular server-side frameworks like Ruby On Rails and Laravel. If you want to find information associated with a particular account or query what buttons users click in your app there is a good chance SQL can help you out!SQL: Pronounced “S-Q-L” or “Sequel” — you choose.SQL alternativesBefore we hop on the SQL train to Database Town I’d like to acknowledge some alternatives. You can use ORMs to query databases. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapper, which is a fancy way of saying that you can write code in a programming language like PHP or Node.js that translates to SQL queries. Popular ORMs are Active Record for Ruby On Rails, Eloquent for Laravel and Sequelize for Node.js. All of these services allow you to write code that translates to SQL under the hood. SQL is important for building applications with these technologies.There are many databases that do not use SQL, such as MongoDB and GraphQL. These are newer technologies and not as widely adopted as relational databases. Relational databases have been around a very long time and power the majority of data storage on the internet. To fully appreciate NoSQL technologies and the reasons they came about it’s helpful to know how relational databases and SQL work.Resources for learning SQLBefore sharing some code samples and details of the SQL programming language itself, I’d like to call out resources from Khan Academy and Laracasts. Both of these are great resources to learn SQL and begin your adventure!Intro to SQL: Querying and managing data | Khan AcademyLearn how to use SQL to store, query, and manipulate data. SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for…www.khanacademy.orgUnderstanding JoinsThe reality is that, when I was first learning about SQL, it took me too long to fully understand the different types…laracasts.comCode samplesAll of the code samples for this post are available in the SQL folder of the acing coding interviews repository I created.connor11528/coding-interviewscoding-interviews — 🎓 :octocat: Preparation resources for software and web technical interviewsgithub.comGet your environment set upIn order for SQL to work you’re going to need a database of some type. The Khan Academy course (above) has an in-browser REPL that evaluates queries against a SQLite database. SQLite is a lightweight popular database commonly used in mobile app storage and development. You can use a tool like Sequel Pro, install MySQL or fire up a Laravel application to create a database environment to run queries against.Create a tableThe first thing to know is that relational databases (such as MySQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL) are made up of tables. One database can hold many tables and each table consists of a particular category of record. For example, in an eCommerce site we might have tables for orders, users, transactions and products. In many web applications you’ll create tables through migrations, but it’s still helpful to be able to read and write SQL create statements.create table exercise_logs (   id integer primary key autoincrement,    type text,   minutes integer,    calories integer,    heart_rate integer);The above SQL statement creates a table called exercise_logs with five columns (id, type, minutes, calories and heart_rate). Each column has a specific data type, such as integer or text.On the second line of our create statement we specify that each new record will have a unique id, known as the table’s primary key.The structure and definition of a database’s tables is known as the database’s schema.Insert data into a tableTo add an exercise log to our table we can write a SQL insert statement.insert into exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) values ('biking', 30, 100, 110);In this example we specify the table name, exercise_logs and the columns for which we’d like to insert data. After the values keyword we include the data to be inserted into the database.Select statementsFor many professions, querying data using SQL select statements is their primary bread and butter.To select all records from a database:select * from exercise_logs;To find all the activities a user engaged in and the total amount of calories they burned doing that activity you could write:select type, sum(calories) as total_calories from exercise_logs group by type;All of these exercises are direct examples from the Khan Academy course. I highly recommend it if you’d like to learn SQL!You can do all kinds of funky stuff like determine the number of students had which letter grade.You could group each of the exercises by heart rate zones./* Group the count of exercises by each heart rate zone */select count(*),      case             when heart_rate > 220 - 30 then 'above max'            when heart_rate > round(.9 * (220 - 30)) then 'above target'    when heart_rate > round(.5 * (220 - 30)) then 'within target'    else 'below target'    end as 'heart_rate_zone'from exercise_logsgroup by heart_rate_zone;SQL is very helpful for reporting purposes. It can be used to filter marketing results, find customer information, search server logs or create reporting dashboards.Subqueries and LikeSometimes you’d like to dynamically grab data with a query and use that result in another query. For this case we have subqueries. For example, we could have a table called drs_favorites that holds doctor recommended activities:/* This is a comment */create table drs_favorites (   id integer primary key,    /* Unique identifier */  type text,                 /* Type of activity */  reason text                /* Why the doctor recommends it */);insert into drs_favorites  (type, reason)   values ('running', 'improves cardiovascular health.');For our main query we would like to find all the activities in the activity_log table that doctors recommended for improving cardiovascular health.SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason LIKE \"%cardiovascular%\");In between the parenthesis we have a subquery that selects all the records where the word “cardiovascular” is included somewhere in the reason the doctor recommends it. Read more about the LIKE operator. Note that SQL can use capital or lowercase letters.ConclusionThat’s the tip of the iceberg! The exercise code, including joins and SQL statements to talk to multiple databases are available on this Github repository.If you’d like to play around with a test database and write some queries, W3schools has a SQL editor available here:SQL Tryit Editor v1.5Edit descriptionwww.w3schools.comHappy coding!ProgrammingSqlDatabaseLearning To CodeCareersOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Connor LeechWeb Developer in the Bay Area.

Follow me on Twitter and FacebookJul 4, 2017Best JavaScript Books In 2017by Bradley Nice, Content Manager at ClickHelp.coWikipedia defines JavaScript the following way:JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.So what are the top trending books about JavaScript?JavaScript: The Good Parts (eBook — $13.49, paperback — $18.41)Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:SyntaxObjectsFunctionsInheritanceArraysRegular expressionsMethodsStyleBeautiful featuresYou Don’t Know JS Book Series (6 Books)You Don’t Know JS: Up & Going (eBook — $0.00, paperback — $4.99)You Don’t Know JS: Scope & Closures (eBook — $11.79, paperback — $15.06)You Don’t Know JS: this & Object Prototypes (eBook — $11.79, paperback — $18.65)You Don’t Know JS: Types & Grammar (eBook — $11.79, paperback — $17.42)You Don’t Know JS: Async & Performance (eBook — $15.33, paperback — $19.89)You Don’t Know JS: ES6 & Beyond (eBook — $11.79, paperback — $17.54)JavaScript: The Definitive Guide (eBook — $27.72, paperback — $9.90)This Fifth Edition is completely revised and expanded to cover JavaScript as it is used in today’s Web 2.0 applications.

      "prefix=item.html_text, event=string, value=Gilbert MitullahI am an education entrepreneur, lawyer and policy advisor.Aug 5, 2017The problem with school choice in educating the poor in KenyaChildren study at a private non-formal school, one of about 120 in the in Mathare slum, in Nairobi, Kenya, June 2, 2015. (Hilary Heuler / VOA) Retrieved from: https://www.voanews.com/a/private-schools-for-kenya-poor-sparl-controversy/2809200.html on 05/08/2017What is school choice?The term “school choice” appears in human capital theory and spreads out into capitalist politics where it has been associated with the right wing and conservatives. School choice is often linked to Milton Friedman and the free market approach. It is premised on the idea that education is a market and that market forces apply in the context of competition between schools, allowing parents to make choices based on the quality of services offered by each school. In this sense, private schools, even private schools for the poor, are competing against government schools and other private schools.How does this work in Kenya?Kenya has three kinds of schools, public, private and APBET. Public schools are run by the government and target all learners, private schools by individuals or corporate entities and target the rich and middle class , and APBET Schools are a hybrid model that should offer alternatives to public provision through NGOs, CBOs and FBOs, but have been invaded by private entities to some extent and are generally considered private schools for the poor. For the proponents of school choice, all of these schools are fair game, they are in competition even if they don’t know it or accept it.What is the problem with school choice in Kenya?For you to choose, you must be able to distinguish and this requires information. Most parents who are choosing don’t have all the information they need and therefore make choices based on perceptions. Marketing and PR could easily change perceptions, and word of mouth, as markets work is also effective. In this sense, parents make choices based on advertisements, or the influence of other parents and not on concrete facts.Private providers of education owe their customers quality, but their customers don’t have any enforceable rights against the providers except in consumer protection laws as opposed to the Constitutional right to basic education that accrues to citizens with reference to public schools. Given that consumer protection laws are insufficient to partner with the best interest rule for children, there aren’t enough protections.With school choice, everyone chooses, but some have more choices than others. Accordingly, school choice doesn’t account for inequitable provision for minority groups like special needs learners, the poorest in society, girls who are left out or locked out of the education system or those who are marginalised because it is market determined. In this sense, its constitutionality as a general government approach would be challenged.School choice segregates by ensuring that the poor learn with the poor and the rich learn with the rich, and there is no equitable way to remedy this challenge. It therefore enhances systemic inequalities directly and indirectly and doesn’t account for social justice in the larger scheme of things because it is not out to make sure everyone enjoys the right to education. It only caters for those who are interested and can afford it.School choice advances the idea of accountability to the market, not the systems put in place by government. The approach advocates for fewer regulations or deregulation because the customers are the ones to determine what is good or bad and if they don’t like what is bad, they can leave. School choice expects education as a market to fix itself and have nobody with the regulatory oversight to interfere too much.School choice comes at a cost. It is a market, and this is business, so those who can’t afford it must step aside. Even for the poorest, they must pay. If they cannot pay, they are excluded. Some may argue that “not all schools” are money hungry or “not all students” are forced to pay, but the schools are premised on fees and that is the crux of their existence and from a macro-level, the approach is flawed.School choice in Kenya advances the cycle of poverty- the options that have been offered don’t attempt to break the situated cycles of poverty. They insist that the best schools for the poor are in the places where they live, where cycles of poverty are entrenched. In this sense, the poor may get education but its only as good as the market decides it is, and if the competitors are not working hard to improve quality, then there are no advancements to be expected.School choice seldom factors in cultural context, citizenship and social responsibility as part of the roadmap to success. The market approach ensures that students pass exams, if there are skills to be taught that they teach them, but it seldom enforces values education in its ethos.How does the system favour school choice?1. The government of Kenya has not done enough to improve the quality of learning in public schools. It invests plenty of money, but the management of the system is too vast and complex for existing government systems to harness. Teacher absenteeism, insufficient infrastructure, lack of facilities still hamper many schools and it gets worse the further away from Nairobi you go.2. Public schools are still unable to cater for all learners in spite of the massive investments placed in them by government and school choice then becomes viable as private providers are legitimised. Even then, those who have been locked out of school for various reasons still cannot access schooling because a new barrier in the form of cost has been introduced.3. The government is still failing in its role as regulator particularly in the enforcement of school standards, sometimes because it is poorly resourced, and at other times because it is indolent.4. Proper training of Ministry of Education personnel is required to address the ever-changing faces of education globally regarding innovation and technology, which may facilitate the advancement of outfits around school choice that harm the system from a macro-level approach.5. Public school systems are not responsive to the changing needs of society, especially for the poor and so the poor feel like they have to take their destiny into their own hands and find options. The options they land on are private schools targeting them and since they don’t see better, they chose what they can get, even though they wish public schools could provide quality education as they prefer them.What do we do about school choice now that it is here with us?1. Have information- research and aggressive, updated data collection sanctioned by government agencies is required round the clock. Individuals also need to read and keep themselves updated on changes, progress and areas that they can flag and address their representatives in parliament, county assemblies and other government agencies on.2. Greater public investments in education, and PPP models that can be pursued by county governments with the support of central government. The main issue here is money, and so the government must figure out a better way to finance equitable access to quality education for all without selling the future of Kenyans, or neglecting them altogether.3. I would suggest the setup of a Ministry of Education taskforce on school choice and the privatisation of education in Kenya is required to address the challenges in the education sector and to gather data, views, school numbers and develop strategies to address this growing phenomenon that is sweeping across the continent.4. Mediating challenges the Ministry of Education is facing by involving all stakeholders in the discourse and in charting the road map to prosperity. The question we must all ask is, what do poor people need, protection or opportunity, and are these two aspects mutually exclusive? Can there be both protection and opportunity with a market approach as opposed to a welfare state approach?The most important question to ask is:Do poor people deserve agency in determining their future, and how is this agency mediated where they are unable to wield it, when they have fewer choices than the richer members of Kenyan society?OR in other words,How important are the poor to us?EducationKenyaPovertyPolicySchool ChoiceOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Gilbert MitullahI am an education entrepreneur, lawyer and policy advisor.\n",

Find, manage and share all of your developer services with 1 account on Manifold. Use code HACKERNOON2018 to get $10 off any service.A “remote-reliant” or “partially distributed” organization relies on both co-located employees, at one or more offices; and distributed, or remote, employees, often working in their own homes or at coworking spaces. The topic is close to my heart because I lead engineering at a remote-reliant organization, Manifold.co. I have also worked remotely at other partially distributed organizations for over 15 years.In a previous blog post, I presented my thoughts on the fundamentals — the costs and benefits — of a key business decision: should your company be remote-reliant, supporting remote work as a first class component of building a team?My answer is yes! For this post, we’ll assume that yours is too. But as I described it before, if that’s your choice, you have added significant new constraints and opportunities to your business. The situation is complex. How can you make this work?One approach that I believe can improve complex situations is to focus on simply reducing costs and amplifying benefits, prioritizing your options for value relative to cost. This puts you on a path to action and can be used in a feedback loop for continuous improvement.In my previous analysis of remote-reliant organizations, costs were centered around interactions between multiple people. You have challenges around empathy, communication, and alignment. Benefits were centered around individuals: you naturally get greater focus, autonomy, and candidate availability.Once we identify the costs and benefits of remote-reliant work, what can we do about them? That’s my focus for this post. For both costs and benefits, I’ll look at ideas pertinent to the organizational, team, and individual levels. My background is in software development, which colors my perspective, but I believe many of my ideas are pertinent to any remote-reliant organization.Reducing Costs in OrganizationsBest PracticesI recently had a video call with someone on our partially distributed team about a frustration he was having. We’ll call him “Lucas.” Lucas wanted to land a code cleanup, but felt that the feedback from a coworker, whom we’ll call “Max,” was blocking him unnecessarily. Moreover, he didn’t feel comfortable talking to Max about it. He even felt a little intimidated.Lucas and Max hadn’t crossed paths significantly except at more critical moments. When they did, they didn’t have a relationship that helped them build a feeling of mutual respect and understanding. That led to silent frustration and friction, rather than open discussion and progress.In discussion, Lucas and I agreed that the key long-term step that he needed to take was to build a relationship with Max. He needed to invest in the three costs I highlighted above for distributed teams: communication, empathy, and alignment.The punchline, though, is that Lucas and Max were co-located in the same office.Empathy, alignment, and good communication are well-studied challenges for every organization. Therefore, my first, and perhaps most important, advice, is that partially distributed organizations should invest in general-purpose organizational best practices. I’d argue that the only difference is that you’ll need to apply them with more rigor and energy in a partially distributed team. You’ll then reap benefits with everyone, co-located and remote alike.I attempt to adhere to many standard organizational rules. Write important things down, in a place everyone can find them. Talk to one another clearly about goals and expectations. Be as transparent as possible about the reasons behind decisions. Have an agenda for meetings, and respect start and end times. Have regular one-on-ones. Find a structure and a process that allow people as much autonomy as possible while being aligned with their team and the company, providing drive and meaning. Build in opportunities for individual, team, and organizational growth.Andy Grove talks about these basics and much more in High Output Management, for instance. The same could be said of Ray Dalio’s Principles. I also like An Everyone Culture, Reinventing Organizations, and more. None of these books are about remote work, but all of them, in my opinion, present important fundamentals and innovations for a highly functioning, meaningful organization, whether it’s distributed, partially distributed, or co-located. Start here.From the other side, the CEO of Doist, a fully distributed company, tells us that remote-first companies need to pursue trust, decentralization, communication, and transparency.Again, I agree wholeheartedly . But to me, this is generically good advice for any organization, not just for a fully or partially distributed company.That said, accomplishing some of the standard organizational goals may be trickier in a partially distributed company. For instance, while enabling individual growth is a standard organizational goal, I do find that it can be tricky for partially distributed companies. It’s difficult to make sure that remote employees are not disadvantaged.For one thing, make sure that remotes have equal support for learning. Pairing is certainly possible remotely, but doesn’t have as high of a communication bandwidth as working side by side. On the other hand, lunch and learns, mentoring programs, and other learning opportunities can work well, should be available to everyone, and can be recorded when appropriate and feasible, for even greater shared benefit.Also, make sure that remote employees see that they can actually grow in the organization. Is your exec team partially distributed? Are top technical, product, and marketing leaders partially distributed? If not, remote employees may not perceive opportunities, or get the support they need. Remotes will ideally see that their perspectives are represented and understood throughout, and that they have people who can coach them in being successful in a remote environment. Being remote ideally won’t limit the company’s appreciation of their work, or their opportunities to explore new responsibilities and roles.Tools, Equipment and InfrastructureBeyond these best-practice guidelines that are largely applicable to any organization, at the top level you’re left with a lot of tool, equipment and infrastructure choices to support partially distributed teams. Many of these are well-tread ground, so I’ll move through them quickly. I’ve included a few you might not have considered, so I hope they are at least worth a skim.Cloud-based toolsTrello. It is so flexible and handy in so many ways that it approaches being a must-have for me. Remotes can be on an equal footing for live planning exercises, long term high level tracking, or organizing events in a simple, visual way.Cloud docs with strong online collaboration capabilities, like Google docs.Social tools. We currently use Slack and Blogin, along with HeyTaco, donut.ai, and a potpourri of Bitmoji.Other standard domain specific tools, like Github/Gitlab, cloud runtime and developer services, and so on.Equipment and infrastructure for everyone(consider supplying, reimbursing, or otherwise supporting these)Webcams (video calls make a huge difference)Headphones (supports music in the office and quality calls for everyone)Reliable, fast internet (sometimes making the obvious explicit is important)Equipment and infrastructure for co-located workersDesks for visiting remote employeesAreas, times, and/or technology support for people to talk with remote workers without bothering other people in the officeIf you are considering an arcade machine, pool table, or table tennis for the office, consider instead one or two game systems loaded with networked co-op games. These can open co-located workers to relaxing and playing not only among themselves but also with remotes, if they have the same system.A spare computer to use when someone has to send theirs in for repairsEquipment and infrastructure for remote workers(consider reimbursement or other support for some or all of these)Tethering (even good home internet goes down sometimes, and tethering can keep you working)A good place to work conducive to focus and callsA way for remote workers to get a fast temporary replacement computer when theirs has to go in for repairsThat’s it. Like the best practices I listed above, none of these tools and infrastructure are particularly unusual, and most or all of them will probably feel like common sense.In sum, organizations don’t necessarily have to make unusual choices to mitigate the cost of distributed work — neither the processes nor the tools I listed would be out of place in a co-located work environment — but leaders do have to make considered choices, listen to feedback from all sides, and iterate to achieve organizational goals.This post is part of a seriesPart 1: You are hereRead part 2Read part 3Read part 4This is story is brought to you by Hacker Noon’s weekly sponsor, Manifold.

Also: triathlon and yoga.Nov 22, 2017Consensus Launches the Decentralized Governance PlatformTallinn, Estonia — Today, Consensus Foundation is announcing the launch of the Consensus AI project, a decentralized artificial intelligence for collective governance.Consensus is the open-sourced platform, powered by native cryptocurrency and built with the vision to improve the governance mechanisms at all levels of organizational structures: communities, companies, NGOs, cities, counties or, eventually, the entire countries.As the world is getting increasingly complex, the governance mechanisms currently in use are becoming rapidly outdated and inadequate for the evolving societal and environmental complexity. This will present limitations to our co-existence in the near future, unless new frameworks are developed and deployed. Consensus aims to build new systems that will address these upcoming challenges and will allow effective collective governance using advanced blockchain and AI technologies.The New Collective Governance PlatformIn a short number of years the following global trends are expected to gain importance: a) countries with the progressive outlook will issue electronic identities to their citizens; b) forward looking jurisdictions will launch their own cryptocurrencies; c) the rise of artificial intelligence will eventually automate everything that could be automated; d) the increasing global mobility and demand for highly skilled work will see countries competing for top talent in a similar manner private companies do.It will be problematic for the old governance structures to keep up with these exponential global changes, and the governments will need to adopt new frameworks to remain relevant and competitive. Entire countries will need to move faster to attract, invest in and retain top citizens and businesses by increasing transparency and efficiency of their operations and by adopting new technologies that will become available. To improve legislation and economic policy, governments will also need to collect and analyze vast amount of data which will require greater participation and involvement from the citizens. Currently, these mechanism are incredibly out of date in most parts of the world. Many people still vote once in 4–5 years and that is the extent of their participation in governance of their own country and society. As Ralph Merkle puts it in DAO, Democracy and Governance paper: “Economically rational citizens should not vote”.The aim of the Consensus project is to help the old systems to transition to the new kind of decentralized collective governance, which is built on the principles of interdependence and interconnectedness of factors and is using advanced AI algorithms to model potential scenarios predicting short-term and long-term consequences and externalities. With this Consensus will allow citizens and community members authenticated with eIDs to have better visibility into the governance issues, enjoy better inclusiveness and have the ability to propose and influence various decisions such as budget allocation and monitor the public projects execution. On the other hand, governmental bodies will gain the necessary input from the citizens, data analysis and simulation of the decision outcomes.Consensus DevelopmentThe first stage of Consensus development will include building a decentralized Research Platform for public opinion data collection in exchange for native cryptocurrency rewards. This will help different organizations and governmental bodies to make more informed decisions and to prepare research proposals, saving time and resources involved in running costly public surveys. Subsequently, Consensus is planning to launch the AI Advisor, a machine learning service that will provide automated, data-driven solutions to the most complex problems of our collective governance by modelling the potential policy and economic decision outcomes of proposed changes using a multitude of data sources, including public opinion research, open and proprietary data.In the later stages, Consensus will open the network for developers and entrepreneurs to build various Dapps using the Consensus smart contract functionality, eID-authenticated trusted nodes, AI capabilities and any integrated public registries. We believe that Consensus can help foster the adoption and legitimization of smart contracts and eID signatures by governments, leading to transactions executed on the distributed ledger to have legal power in the respective jurisdiction. We anticipate that the early Dapps will be the social projects funding and the open tender systems, that will allow to transparently propose, evaluate and finance various public projects, select stakeholders for execution and monitor the progress.E-Residency IntegrationEstonia, being a forerunner of the future digital world, has already implemented some of these ideas — for example the electronic IDs have been in use in the entire country for the last 15 years, with the vast majority of services available online — everything from health records to public transportation, to accessing banking, to signing contracts, to voting — is done using the digital ID, saving the country 2% of its GDP annually. One of the more forward looking ideas is the recent proposal to launch the national crypto token, Estcoin, and its funding and development with a public token sale.Another innovation by Estonia, the e-Residency program, introduced 3 years ago, serves as the basis for this digital society of the future and highlights the global trend that the world is moving rapidly towards a single market and global citizenship. E-Residency allows everyone in the world to apply and gain access to the subset of digital services Estonian citizens have enjoyed for years.Consensus initial work will be launched within e-Residents community of 25,000 early adopters as a pilot.Kaspar Korjus, the managing director of e-Residency commented on the Consensus announcement — “We are very proud that Consensus AI has decided to launch its project by offering a chance for e-residents to be the first adopters. The e-Residency programme is always keen on supporting new services and opportunities for our community of forward thinkers and passionate advocates for innovative and disruptive ideas.”Consensus StoryConsensus project is founded by Oleg Gutsol, a Canadian entrepreneur and software developer, who most recently served as the Head of Global Growth of the Republic of Estonia e-Residency and previously was the CEO and founder of 500px, a global photo distribution platform with the highest quality content powered by image recognition and machine learning algorithms.After departing from 500px in 2014 and travelling for an extended period of time, Oleg saw, firsthand, the economic and ecological crises people are facing in different parts of the world. Many of these problems are caused by inefficient allocation of resources and funds, limited perspective and outdated governance practices. Later, he joined the e-Residency team to lead the growth of the initiative and had the opportunity to experience how the most progressive digital nation is operating from the inside.In the course of his work at e-Residency, Oleg realized that many countries are interested in progressing towards digital governance, however, may not have the necessary structures and resources for such as a transition. In order to make the transparent and efficient governance available to all organizational structures, Consensus project gathered a team of senior professionals in a wide variety of fields of expertise, including open-source software, artificial intelligence, public administration, global scale product development, blockchain and others.The team analyzed the opportunity and developed a product strategy for the Consensus project and is now preparing for the funding stage of the project, conducted via a token sale.

Building software, studying humans, designing interactions, thinking society.Nov 23, 2017Stupid Science: I compared 23 sticky notes to help you spare wallet and planetOver the past months, I’ve done short instructional videos on how to use sticky notes (in French — you’re welcome to help in subtitling!). The main goals are to share best practices and make it easier for professional facilitators to ready participants.One of the announced videos was “which sticky note model should I choose?”. It took a bit longer than expected to deliver. There was good reason for that delay though: I went overboard with scope in order to answer the question properly 😁Thus, I present: “which sticky notes should you choose out of 23, based on way too much data”. (Want to get straight to the result? Ah, you’re missing on all the fun… just scroll down to the end 😉)DimensionsI compared products based on the issues most often encountered when using sticky notes in a professional agile setting:How well does the sticky stay on a wall over time?How likely is the ink to leak through a note?How hard is it to open the pack?How expensive are packs?How socially and environmentally sustainable is the product?How bad does the pack smell when you open it? 😄After specific experiments, I rated each product on a 0-to-5 index for each of these dimensions.Choosing the models to compareI just took all the sticky notes I could get my hands on! And then, I thought 8 wasn’t worth it to run one-month-long experiments, so I just hunted and bought all the standard size, acceptably priced stickies on Amazon France.I said I compared the “standard size” models. I never bought that stuff. Never.I want to thank the AgileFrance association for supporting my efforts advancing the world’s knowledge on such a critical topic: if I was able to compare 23 models and not 8, that’s because I got a grant for it as a community member. Volunteering time + sharing financial resources = 💖All the compared models next to each other23 models is not 23 brandsSo, what do we have on trial? The 3M common models: Post-It, Post-It Mini, Post-It Super Sticky (normal and XL), Post-It Recycled and the Tesa global competitor.Some more local models. Common in France: Lyreco, Office Depot Recycled, Apli Classic, Apli Néon. I also discovered Germany produces some: Idena, Kyome Haftnotizklotz, Paperfoxx. And obviously, China and Taiwan: AB.M Idea, Cosanter JinXin, Stick’N Pop-up notes, Tiger Block.Finally, a few almost “noname” from big EU distributors: 5 stars, Q-Connect, Snopake, NiceDay, Tartan; and an actual white label: a Red Cross-provided pack that was just lying around and that I included as a comparison element.Enough with the context already, let’s make some science out of these pieces of paper! 😁Before unwrapping.StickinessHow many times have you moved a sticky note around, clustered it with some others, only to find it on the ground when you go back to the whiteboard after lunch break?Since spatial position usually encodes information (or at least it should because human brains will believe it does anyway), falling stickies means lost information.Experimental processI set up two different testing grounds to simulate common situations.Hey, somebody asked for it.One on a South-facing modern glass window: perfectly flat surface exposed to direct sunlight (Paris in August, 15–32°C, 160h of cumulated sunlight), ventilation holes and window next to it always open to ensure humidity variation. Since humidity is more controlled in offices, this simulates a whiteboard over a longer timeYellow is hours of sunlight, red is max temperature, blue is min temperature. Data from MeteoFrance.The other trial surface was a painted wall in the same room: same humidity variations but never exposed to direct sunlight, and slightly grainier. This simulates an office wall over a longer time.I obviously stuck notes following best practice, ensured equal force was applied on all of them, and thoroughly cleaned both surfaces beforehand.DiscussionAll stickies were much more stable than expected. None fell over 30 days! I suspect this is the consequence of using my full weight to stick them, as that was the only way to ensure consistent force.Another hypothesis was that they went straight from pack to wall and the glue was more efficient this way, but I ran a parallel experiment over two hours trying to measure after how many sticking-unsticking cycles the glue would run out, and it turns out the limit is above 150. I could measure no difference in falling tendencies. Even with a fan under the note for 5 minutes. Crazy, right.It also appears that there is no perceivable change in stickiness between 20 days and 30 days. In a similar fashion, the window surface increases overall stickiness, but products fared comparably on both surfaces. Put otherwise, either the glue is poor right from the start and for all surfaces, or it has good chances to stay for long.ResultsSince I received each model on a different date, I could not have 30 days of exposure for all of them. However, since days 20 and 30 had no difference in measured stickiness for models that were exposed that long, and since wall surface simply made it easier to spot glue failure without changing tendencies, it is sufficient to observe the wall at day 20.I rated each model based on the following scale:Adherence distribution5 = perfect adherence4 = tooting visible on detailed inspection3 = tooting visible 1 meter afar2 = not readable from all angles1 = about to fallYou should thus prefer one of the 8 products with the best glue, especially if you intend to leave your stickies on the wall for a long time: the 3M Post-It Recycled or Super Sticky models, the Cosanter JinXin, Lyreco, Q-Connect, Stick’N or Tartan. Other brands can still have good sticking power, but I won’t list all of them inline. You can look at the data if you’re curious 😉Ink penetrationWrite down your idea on that sticky note with a marker (properly), remove it from the pack and stick it on the wall (properly), correct a typo on it, realise that you stained both the wall and the second sticky. Rage.Sticky notes that let ink go through are at best environmental and financial waste, at worst used as an unreadable medium by participants.Experimental processMarkers have different inks and solvents, ranging from very light (like a pen) to very strong (like a paint marker). In order to represent that range, I taped 6 of them together, ensured their tips were perfectly aligned, and pushed that tool on the stickies packs.I hit stickies packs strongly with that tool from about 10 cm above, and kept pushing down for 5 seconds.I then counted the visible dots on each following note. In order to reduce variation, I repeated that process 3 times for each product.I counted dots on each note, and took the mean of the three runs. For example, for the series on the left, each column is a run. The first note (obviously) has all 6 tips visible. Two tips always leak on the sticky that comes next on the pack, thus mean is 2 for note 2. The third note has one run with 0 dots, one with 1 dot, one with 2 dots. The mean is thus (0+1+2)/3 = 1.I counted means this way until note 6 (no model leaked beyond that point, which is already considerable). It is worth noting, however, that leaking in this stress-test trial does not mean leakage would be systematically observed in standard usage: the pressure applied is much stronger and much longer.ResultsDistribution of mean ink penetration by note depth. Colour intensity represents number of models leaking that number of dots on that note.Even with the importance of the applied stress, the range of possibilities is very wide, as shown in the distribution graph. Two models never leaked beyond note 2 (3M Recycled Post-It and Stick’N Pop-up Notes), while some kept leaking until note 6 (notably NiceDay, which consistently let one marker type through).Green means no leakage, yellow means lower-than-median leakage, red means above or equal leakage.In order to ease comparison across dimensions, I computed an index for the “ink penetration” dimension. This index normalises the means for all notes to a mark from 0 to 5. Look at the data if you want the exact formula.Ease of openingThe brainstorming session starts. One participant runs out of sticky notes. As you’re well prepared, you take a new pack out of your bag.“Does anyone have scissors?” Nope. Two minutes of fighting with plastic wrapping ensue. It was a fun break, but the participant lost focus and forgot their idea.Experimental processPurely human-based and biaised. I rated each pack from 1 (impossible to open without a cutting utensil) to 5 (excellent affordance and usage of the self-opening device). I did not get all models as new packs, some are consequently not rated in this dimension.ResultsDistribution of ease of opening the packPackaging does not seem to be an integral part of product design for most brands. The ones that are awarded a 5 clearly show a precut easy opening (3M Post-it Recycled), or a ribbon to tear the plastic wrapping : Cosanter, Idena, Q-Connect, Paperfoxx and Tesa.The worst rankings were for a few brands seemingly taking pleasure in using the most shreddable plastic wrapping with strong glue (Snopake), or in suggesting ways to open that are even less productive than tearing the packaging apart (Stick’N Pop-up notes).The case of 3M plastic-wrapped products (i.e. all but Recycled Post-it Notes) is interesting. Indeed, the precutting does work very well if you know how to use it (see video). Functionality is good, but discoverability is so bad this package-opening tutorial is the most popular video in the series!PriceExperimental processVery simple: divide the price of a pack by the number of stickies in it 😉 I did not take transportation costs into account as they are not linear, and can be offset if you buy other products in the same order.DiscussionPrices can vary over time due to dynamic pricing in online retailers. It is also possible that you will get different prices depending on the retailer, or get a sale or a discount. I minimised this effect by recording only the standard prices of a single retailer (Amazon), over a single week. The main aim being to compare prices relatively to each other, I believe this allows for a fair evaluation of the incurred costs.ResultsDistribution of the prices of a single sticky notePrices vary wildly from the cheapest Chinese product with notes worth less than a cent to the fanciest at a sixth of an euro a piece.I did not buy the few even more expensive products for this study, as they are too expensive to be considered in a professional usage anyway.The median price is 0.02 €, and anything more expensive than 0.05 € a note is clearly a ripoff.I normalised these results on a 0 to 5 scale simply by linearly rating the price from most expensive (0) to least expensive (5).SmellA displeasing smell is not only a matter of comfort. Smell indeed mostly comes from solvent, which means it can be a sign of harmful chemicals used in the adhesive that you’re going to put your hands on and let evaporate in your working space for days.Beyond the (admittedly limited) risk to health of small doses, an uncomfortable smell on pack opening is always a distraction to the group, and can induce headaches in the most sensitive participants.Experimental processOnce again, easy and biased. If I don’t smell anything when I open the pack, I award 5. The worse and longer it smells, the less points.ResultsDistribution of (lack of) smellThe vast majority of products have no smell at all when opened. But the worst, Tiger Block, had me breathing through the mouth for about 10 minutes.The case of the Tartan brand is interesting. Indeed, it disappoints in the smell dimension, while it scored well everywhere else. Concurrently, while this brand is basically nonexistent on the internet, its production address is… the same as 3M’s! I thus suspected this product to be a “noname” cheaper version of the 3M Post-it Notes, but at least the solvent used is different.SustainabilityWe know what stickies are for, but we don’t often think about where they come from and where they go when they die 😉As agile or collective intelligence professionals, wouldn’t it be fitting that we ensure the sustainability of the tools we use to help others reach sustainable efficiency?What kind of waste does one brainstorming session create?Experimental processI researched each brand for its certifications and policies, and awarded points on the following elements:2.5 points for paper: recycled and FSC certified sustainable sources give points, the higher proportion the better.Half a point for both sustainable adhesive sources and solvent-less glue.1 point for carbon footprint: 0.75 for producing in the EU (if you’re on another continent, this should be awarded to producers in your vicinity); 0.25 for assessing lifecycle carbon footprint.Half a point for both recyclable packaging and guaranteed recyclability.ResultsThree products stands out. The 3M Recycled Post-it reaches a high score thanks to its 100% recycled paper and recycled cardboard packaging. The only other brand with a recycled cardboard packaging, Stick’N, lost the associated points because said package also contained a glued sponge (!) used to lift up the notes from beneath. 3M products also get a further bonus thanks to their Pulp and Paper Sourcing Policy, explicitly asking since 2015 all 3M provider chain to respect not only the natural enviroment, but also the rights of workers, indigenous people and rural communities.An equivalent socially responsible policy is claimed by GlobalNotes, the German manufacturer for both Paperfoxx and Tesa. They are also obviously advantaged for producing in the EU (if you’re in the US, 3M is thus even better as they produce in Kentucky). But beyond that, though the notes are not made from 100% recycled paper, their durable paper sourcing is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. These brands don’t benefit from their plastic wrapping, but compensate by using water-based solvents.Distribution of sustainability indexesThis is what the German brand Idena lacks, along with a socially responsible sourcing policy.The 3M Super Sticky models follow, thanks to their durable adhesive (67% by weight coming from annual plants, as opposed to chemical production). The attention to adhesive also gives a boost to Apli, a Spanish brand not using solvents in its glue.Even the least specific 3M models get acceptable ratings thanks in part to their incorporation of recycled material (0 to 30% depending on the colour), but also because of the care the brand takes in guaranteeing the recyclability of its products: the adhesive and inks have been tested for dissolving in the dye-removal part of the recycling process. This is the only brand in this study claiming to have conducted such tests.It is saddening to see that most brands do not give any message about sustainability in their products. It is also worth noting that no product reaches even 4 out of 5 points in this dimension: no sticky note seems to have the “holy grail” FSC 100% (or 100% recycled) certification for their papers, and even 3M does not (yet?) incorporate its Super Sticky adhesive innovations in all its products.And the winner is…The 3M Recycled Post-it!Classic brand, but a somehow unexpected model. I did not expect the Recycled version to be not only one of the most sustainable, but also so much better at stickiness than its “standard” counterpart, and to outperform all other models in the ink penetration test. Maybe its heavier fabric is to thank.I am thrilled to conclude that the most efficient and cost-effective choice is also the most sustainable!Parting wordsI hope this piece of research was useful and brought some smiles along the way. Beyond producing “stupid science”, having fun and taking agile way too seriously, I believe we have a strong responsibility in educating as “change agents”, “coaches” or whatever we like to call ourselves these days. If you consider switching to this model, even if on pure efficiency or cost-effectiveness ground, use it as an opportunity for a discussion on sustainability with yoursef, your clients, participants and fellow coaches.Through questioning our practices thoroughly, we might well discover other occasions on which the best thing to do for ourselves is also the best for the rest of the world.Please challenge or support this piece based on your experience! 🙂 Science is only reliable when it is reproducible, which is why I tried to describe as precisely as possible everything I did and opened the source data.How to support this workIf you want to equip yourself while supporting this research, you can use the following affiliate links to buy on Amazon:3M Post-it Recycled (large pack, multicolour, accordion).Tesa (multicolour).Cosanter XinJin.I will use this money to give the granted amount back to AgileFrance, making it easier for other members to get funding for their own endeavours.You can subtitle the videos on how to use stickies in your language.If you enjoyed this article, clapping, sharing and subscribing makes me feel good and helps the content reach other readers 🙂⬇️Oh, and please let me know if you do change habits.

Her er noen vanlige bekymringer om Vue, besvart av en rammeverk-rundbrenner.1. “Det ser ut som Angular og jeg hater Angular”Klassiker. Men det eneste som er likt i Angular og Vue er de bra tingene med Angular.TemplatingDet fremhever hvordan man visuelt jobber med strukturering av grensesnittet og reduserer antall linjer.Lett å skumme selv med mye som skjer ☝️Vue-komponenter får en fin tendens til å inneholde nærliggende kode i fornuftig størrelse, mye på grunn av templating.Directives (v-model, v-if…) håndterer så mye arbeid at man slipper å bryte opp prosjekter i haugevis av mikrokomponenter.Vue-komponenter får ofte en “naturlig” størrelse. Hvis man følger atomic design, så vil en Vue-komponent ofte ligge i skillet mellom molekyl og organisme 👇Les her for å forstå bedreTwo-way-data bindingDette gjelder kun på forms i Vue, som gjør det til en fryd å jobbe med skjemaer. Det skaper en direkte binding mellom form-elementer og state, det sparer tid og reduserer linjer.Utenom skjemaer, så følger Vue unidirectional flow (på samme måte som React) og har dermed ikke samme dataflyt som Angular. Data flyter kun nedover. Det gjør det logisk å spore data og plassere ansvar i riktig scope. Det fører til mindre trøbbel.Med unidirectional flow er det enkelt å spore kildenDirectivesDu kan manipulere DOM-elementer med refs og funksjoner som håndterer logikken, litt jQuery-esque. En ryddigere løsning vil være å lage et generisk directive som skaper funksjonaliteten du trenger.Nå kan du bruke <input v-focus> hvor du vil, for at input-feltet automatisk skal få fokus (fordi “autofocus” ikke fungerer på iOS Safari). Pretty nice.Vue kommer med noen ferdiglagde directives. Her er de man bruker oftestv-if/elsev-forv-modelv-bindv-onMer om dette i punkt 2👇2. “Du lener deg på DSL (directives) i stedet for Javascript.”Argumentet mot å bruke DSL er blant annet at Javascript kan gjøre jobben direkte, uten å bli abstrahert. “Hvorfor dra inn ekstra syntaks når vanilje Javascript fungerer fint?”Det er ikke veldig mye DSL i Vue. I praksis er det omtrent 7 du bruker ofte. DSL’en er også nesten identisk med Javascript-syntaks — det er overkommelig å lære. Uten DSL må du sannsynligvis lage lignende funksjonalitet, så det gir mening å løfte oppgavene til rammeverket.Javascript og Vue er verktøy for å bygge nettsider (i dette tilfellet) — de verktøyene som gjør jobben best og raskest på kort og lang sikt vil være mest egnet.Hvis kostnaden av ekstra (som ikke er veldig ekstra) overhead resulterer i raskere utvikling som er enklere å vedlikeholde, bør avveiningen være enkel.Målet er ikke å bli god i Javascript, men å bygge bedre løsninger. Man bygger bedre løsninger med solide Javascript-skills og litt DSL.<input v-model=\"hasDebt\" @keyup.enter.prevent=\"showLoan = true\">Den linjen sparer håndgikta ☝️v-model=\"hasDebt\" tar inputfeltets verdi og binder det til komponentens ‘hasDebt’ state, og oppdaterer automatisk alle steder hvor verdien brukes. Two-way data binding i praksis, som forklart øverst.Neste property gjør 4 ting@keyup lytter til hvert tastetrykk ⌨️ i inputfeltet. Event listener i praksis..enter kjører “showLoan = true” hvis enter ble tastet..prevent kjører .preventDefault() som forhindrer uønskete bieffekter.Man trenger en raus mengde Javascript for å gjøre alt det skuddsikkert på tvers av nettlesere.Det tar ikke allverdens av tid, men det flytter fokuset fra brukeren til detaljer rundt konfigurering.Dette var kun ett eksempel av en event listener, event modifier og key modifier. Når prosjektet vokser kan summen av DSL’ens hjelpende hånd virkelig nytes.3. “Fordelene er ikke store nok til å bytte fra React”.Ettersom React er bransjestandard og fordi teknologivalg ofte lener seg mot React, er det naturlig med en sammenlikning. Vue og React har en ganske lik tilnærming til frontend.Bekymringen “fordelene til Vue er marginale” grunner sannsynligvis i mangel på erfaring med Vue.Les denne for en grundigere sammenlikning 👇Vue eller React?medium.comHvis Vue og React står side om side og måler lengde på penis så er muligens den ene litt lengre, men tynnere, eller omvendt. Noe i den duren. Det er med andre ord ikke der de store forskjellene ligger.Det handler ikke bare om rammeverkets egenskaper. Det handler om helheten til Vue; språket, boilerplatesene, overordnet lesbarhet, dokumentasjonen, friheten til å konfigurere og gode konvensjoner.Det handler også om økosystemet. Vi bruker mye tid med devtools, state-management, router, CLI og server-side-rendering. Disse bør sammenliknes en-for-en mot parallellene til React, men i stedet skal jeg spare deg tid med den uakademiske snarveien til hvordan det funker i praksis.Økosystemet til Vue er enklere å sy sammen, krever mindre boilerplate og kan brukes med færre hensyn, uten å miste kontroll. Du blir glad av å bruke det — det må oppleves! 😃Økosystemet til Vue, av VueVuex (state management)Vuex (state management) — eksempelVue routerNuxt (server side rendering i Vue)Vue CLIVue devtools4. “Er Vue populært nok? Er edgecaser besvart på stackoverflow?”Den offisielle dokumentasjonen er av spesielt høy kvalitet, med mange gode eksempler. Det gjør at problemer ofte løses med en opphevet forståelse av rammeverket, før man plager forumer.Men har du et problem, så finner du svaret på stack-overflow. Trenger du et bibliotek med vuespesifikke handlekurver så finnes det en haug. For å sammenlikne ⭐️ på Github, så har React: 85k, Vue: 80k og Angular: 30k.Stjerner er ikke alt, men det bekrefter at det er en trygghet i fremtiden til Vue og økosystemet.5. “Med React og Angular-kompetanse kan du bygge hybrid apper med react-native og ionic”Du får ekte native Android, iOS og web applikasjoner i én kodebase med Vue Nativescript. Der har du full tilgang til både Android- og iOS-funksjonalitet, med Vue som rammerverk. Nativescript fortjener sin egen artikkel.Weex, NativeScript + Vue, and other tooling will be supported by the team for the long term. We are helping to mature the documentation and bridge the gap to help adoption.6. “Vue låser deg til et rammeverk”Vue er et tynt rammeverk til å bygge grensesnittet med komponenter. Du får også litt krydder som gjør det raskere å arbeide med. Du er allikevel fri til å bruke Javascript overalt. Det er en balansert oppskrift som gir deg akkurat det du trenger, pluss frie tøyler.Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.7. “Vue komponenter følger ikke separation of concerns, det er jo bare spaghetti!”En Vue-komponent inneholder all relevant HTML, CSS og Javascript for den komponenten. “Separation of concerns” handler først og fremst om å gruppere ansvar til logisk sammenhengende enheter. Det skaper separerte ansvarsområder.Å separere HTML, CSS og Javascript til sine egne filer vil i stedet “separate a concern”. Filene blir litt lengre, men brukertester sier gjennomgående at brukere foretrekker scrolling over klikking, fordi det er visuelt og lett tilgjengelig. Utviklere er jo også brukere 🤓En typisk Vue-komponent. Se også at SASS og scoping er satt direkte på style. Sexy?Hva kreves av kompetanse for å lære Vue?Hvis du kan React, så er det megalett å lære Vue. Hvis du er god i Javascript og kan et annet frontend-rammeverk så er det også megalett å lære Vue. Hvis du ikke kan noe annet fra før (men helst ihvertfall litt Javascript) så er tilbakemeldingen fra andre konsekvent: Vue er lett å lære.Ressurser for å lære VueVIDEOLet's begin with a review of basic data binding in Vue.

Father, feminist, scientist, teacher, inventor, programmer, human.Aug 21, 2017We need to learn how to teach machine\\xa0learningJackson Pollock’s ”Untitled.” I think it represents most students understanding of machine learning after taking a\\xa0course.This is a revised version of a position paper I wrote for the ICER 2017 workshop “Learning about Machine Learning.”Knowledge of how to apply machine learning to products is on high demand but low supply. Journalists write endlessly about it, employers want engineers who have it, college students want to learn it, and yet almost no one actually knows it.Unfortunately, knowledge of how to teach machine learning effectively is also scarce, and has been for some time. For example, in my first year of graduate school at Carnegie Mellon in 2002, for example, nearly everyone in my doctoral cohort wanted to take machine learning to apply it to our research, but we soon learned that few of the faculty knew how to teach it well. One professor regularly came to lectures with 100 slides, 98 of which were mathematical proofs, and delivered them in 60 minutes. Another professor who co-taught the course spend the next three days of class trying to explain the proofs. The students who thrived in that class already knew the material; the rest of us learned little of either practical or theoretical value.Some faculty responded by creating more practical courses, but they too struggled to convey what machine learning is and how to use it to solve problems. They focused more on practical skills, such as setting up tooling, understanding a confusion matrix, and preparing data. While these were necessary low-level skills for applying machine learning, fundamental misconceptions lurked underneath those skills, leading my peers and I to use (and sometimes unintentionally abuse) machine learning to advance our research agendas. For example, we assumed the default configurations of machine learning algorithms were suitable for our data. We casually selected features without understanding how they were modeling a phenomenon. We believed when a classifier was successfully built, it was “correct” like procedural programs are correct, despite the broad set of possible data-driven flaws.Now that machine learning is reaching the broader undergraduate masses through MOOCs, through universities classes, and even indirectly through consumer products, I fear these same misconceptions exist but at a much grander scale. We still know little about what students need to know, how to teach it, and what knowledge teachers need to have to teach it successfully.To correct this, I argue that we need to discover the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) necessary for teaching concepts in machine learning. PCK about machine learning includes:Useful representations for concepts in machine learningEffective analogies, examples, and explanations of machine learningKnowledge of which concepts in machine learning are difficult and whyKnowledge of conceptions that learners bring to learning machine learningMethods of informally assessing knowledge of machine learning conceptsCommon mistakes the learners make when applying machine learningIf we knew these things, and we had ways to train teachers about these things, I hypothesize that students would learn how to apply machine learning more efficiently and effectively.One could argue that students and teachers are successful without the knowledge above. After all, students are graduating and apply machine learning to products. I would argue that there are actually very few students applying machine learning to products with an expert-level understanding of how to use, configure, and develop for machine learning algorithms. This is likely why the few who do have this expertise are paid so handsomely. Rather than have companies fight over all-too-scare experts who have successfully acquired knowledge of how to apply machine learning, we need to discover the PCK necessary for helping teachers help many more students successfully learn.Arguing for the importance of PCK is not new. But in a surprising way, the importance of machine learning PCK is possibly even more important than broadly taught subjects such as math, science, and writing. This is because the products that people make with machine learning are imbuing surprising and problematic biases to a range of decisions in law, ethics, automation, and business. The lack of understanding about machine learning by even just a small population of machine learning software developers can have a profound impact on billions of people globally. Helping the 1,000 faculty better teach the next 100,000 developers will impact the next 1,000,000,000 people engaging directly or indirectly with machine learned systems.How can we begin to investigate machine learning PCK? We need to:Study learners’ experiences in learning machine learning.Rigorously and carefully extract the barriers students face in learningEvaluate how well explanations of ML concepts produce understandingDiscover the prior conceptions that conflict with ML learningInvent ways that students and teachers can reliably recognize progress in ML learning.This will require a broad range of researchers and research activity to achieve, not to mention a lot of funding to support these researchers. With the scarcity of funding for similar questions about introductory computing concepts, generating funding to investigate advanced concepts in machine learning could be quite difficult. Now is the time to build coalitions of faculty who teach machine learning, and applications of it in data science and other areas, to investigate this important but nascent research area.Unfortunately, there are some major barriers to doing this research:There’s very little NSF funding for research on learning advanced concepts in computing.Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, and other large companies with the ability to fund or do research on the learning of machine learning don’t fund computing education research. They only fund new algorithms (that future engineers will fail to use successfully because we don’t know how to teach them).All that said, I encounter dozens of doctoral students every year who would love to study this topic, for lack of funding and interest by the broader academic community. Let’s all agree that understanding how to successfully teach machine learning (and how to teach anything in computing) is of fundamental importance if we’re to harness AI effectively.Machine LearningComputing EducationData SciencePedagogyTeacher TrainingOne clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.Andy J.
